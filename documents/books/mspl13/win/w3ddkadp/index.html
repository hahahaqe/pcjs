Introduction to Device Drivers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This document is intended for device driver writers working as consultants
and for Independent Hardware Vendors (IHVs) and computer manufacturers. The
information contained herein is proprietary to Microsoft(R) Corporation.

This introduction provides some background information that you should
review before using the documentation set provided with the Microsoft
Windows(tm) Device Development Kit (DDK). Included here are sections on the
following:


  ■   What you need to know or have before you start

  ■   Description of the manuals provided with the DDK

  ■   Notational conventions used throughout the DDK documentation set




What Should You Know or Have Before Starting?

You will need to know Windows, MS-DOS(R), MASM, and, if writing a printer
driver, the C programming language. Definitions of key terms used in
describing device drivers and virtual devices are provided in Appendix A,
"Terms and Acronyms," which is located in the Microsoft Windows Virtual
Device Adaptation Guide.

The Microsoft Windows Installation and Update Guide for the DDK provides
detailed information on the requirements for setting up your development
environment and installing the software, and on the contents of the source
disks included with the DDK.

You will need to purchase the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
(SDK) and the retail Windows package for testing. You will also need to
purchase access to the Microsoft OnLine software support system to get
technical support while developing your driver.

The Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit contains reference material;
the Windows Resource Compiler (RC); special versions of the SYMDEB, WDEB386,
and CodeView(R) debuggers; header (.H) files; and several utilities that aid
development and testing. It also contains descriptions of all the functions
used by applications. The DDK functions are sometimes version-specific for
3.0 versus 2.x and are not intended as functions for applications.

The SDK also provides several INCLUDE and header files that contain
declarations of all the Windows functions, definitions of many macro
identifiers that you can use in programming, and structure definitions.
Import libraries included in the kit allow LINK to resolve calls to Windows
functions and to prepare the program's .EXE file for dynamic linking.

Microsoft OnLine can provide you with the accurate, interactive support you
need to remain as productive as possible. Use it to retrieve information (on
virtually all of Microsoft's products) from our technical product
KnowledgeBase, to search through our Software Library for sample drivers and
source code, or to submit Service Requests (specific questions on writing
device drivers) directly to one of our highly qualified customer support
engineers. Watch the Exchange Bulletin Board for announcements on the
availability of new sample sources for special devices. For more information
about Microsoft OnLine, call Microsoft Product Support Services
Telemarketing at (800) 443-4672.


DDK Documentation Set

The 3.0 version of the Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit has been
completely reorganized from previous versions. It now consists of the
following four manuals:


  ■   Microsoft Windows Device Driver Adaptation Guide, which covers how to
      write or modify device drivers for Windows 3.0 when running in either
      real or standard mode.

  ■   Microsoft Windows Virtual Device Adaptation Guide, which covers how to
      write virtual devices for Windows 3.0 when running in 386 enhanced
      mode.

  ■   Microsoft Windows Installation and Update Guide, which provides
      information on the DDK source code, test scripts, utilities, and
      building tools provided with, and the development environments
      required for, Windows 3.0 when running in either real, standard, or
      386(tm) enhanced mode.

  ■   Microsoft Windows Printers and Fonts Kit, which includes information
      on the Printer Font Metrics (PFM) file formats and the new PFM Editor,
      along with technical notes on the PCL(R) /HP(R) LaserJet(R) and
      PostScript(R) printer drivers.


We recommend that both novice and advanced device driver and virtual device
writers read the Microsoft Windows Installation and Update Guide, this
introduction, and Chapter 1, "Overview of Windows." After that, you can skip
to the appropriate chapter(s) for the particular driver with which you work.


The following sections summarize the contents of each part and chapter in
the two main DDK documents.


Microsoft Windows Device Driver Adaptation Guide

Part 1, "Writing Windows Device Drivers," consists of nine chapters that
provide information on writing or modifying specific Windows 3.0 device
drivers.

Chapter 1, "Overview of Windows," provides information common to both device
driver and virtual device writers, such as definitions, time requirements,
calling conventions, and INCLUDE file descriptions.

PART I  Writing Windows Device Drivers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This first part of the Microsoft Windows Device Driver Adaptation Guide
provides information on how to write or modify Windows device drivers; make
them compatible and work efficiently with Microsoft Windows 3.0 when running
in both real and standard mode; and make them bimodal, i.e., capable of
running under either real or protected mode.

Separate chapters are provided for descriptions of each of the major device
drivers. Some information that is common to many of the drivers is provided
in Chapter 1, "Overview of Windows." However, most of the common
reference-type information is provided in Part 2, "General Reference for
Device Drivers."






Chapter 1  Overview of Windows
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This chapter contains information that is common to or used by most of the
different Microsoft Windows 3.0 device drivers. Since these drivers may also
interact with enhanced Windows virtual devices (VxDs), references are also
made, where appropriate, to Windows VxDs. The following information is
provided here:


  ■   Definitions of device drivers, virtual devices, programs, and
      libraries

  ■   The role of Windows device drivers and virtual devices

  ■   Estimates on the time required to write a device driver

  ■   Descriptions of the Windows modules and those needed to build a device
      driver

  ■   Explanation of the Windows calling conventions

  ■   Description of the Windows INCLUDE files


Subsequent chapters will detail how to write specific device drivers.
Notice, however, that for some drivers, such as the Mouse and Keyboard
drivers, you should be able to use the supplied source code and not need to
write a new driver.


1.1  What are Device Drivers and Virtual Devices?

A Windows device driver is actually a dynamic-link library (DLL) that
programs call to interact with a particular piece of peripheral hardware
(e.g., a printer or a display screen). This DLL contains the Windows
graphics device interface (GDI) functions needed to access or drive a
specified device or family of devices. It also contains information
describing the types of devices it supports. DLLs are similiar to Windows
applications and are described in more detail in the Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit.

In other words, a device driver is the software that provides the
hardware-dependent, low-level interface between the Windows functions and
the output device.

A separate driver must be written for each type of peripheral in the system
(e.g., for the display, keyboard, printer, and mouse). However, like all
DLLs, this code is loaded into memory only when needed.

An enhanced Windows virtual device (VxD) is separately compiled code that is
loaded and linked with the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) when enhanced
Windows is first started. Each VxD is responsible for handling a specific
piece of hardware or for providing services used by other VxDs or by a
Virtual Machine's (VM's) application program. See the Microsoft Windows
Virtual Device Adaptation Guide for detailed information on VxDs.

In enhanced Windows, the VxD sits between the Windows driver (in the System
VM) and the actual hardware. These two pieces of code can communicate via
established I/O ports, or they can establish a new interface. In addition to
this interaction, the VxD must also serialize access to the hardware ports
by other VMs running simultaneously with Windows. Notice, however, that most
VxDs do not need to handle Windows any differently from other applications.



1.2  Programs vs. Libraries

From the user's perspective, a Windows program and a Windows dynamic-link
library (or device driver, which is a type of DLL) are very different. The
user cannot run a Windows library directly. Windows loads a part of a
library into memory only when a program needs to use a function that the
library provides. The user can, of course, run any Windows program.

In fact, the user can run multiple instances of the same Windows program.
Windows uses the same code segments for the different instances but creates
a unique data segment for each. Windows usually does not run multiple
instances of a Windows library.

From the programmer's perspective, a Windows program is a task that usually
creates and manages windows on the display. Libraries are modules that
assist the task. A programmer can write additional library modules that one
or more programs can use. For the programmer, one important distinction
between programs and libraries is that a Windows library does not have its
own stack; instead, the library uses the stack of the program that calls the
function in the library.

DLLs are also similar to run-time libraries, such as the C run-time
libraries. The main difference is that DLLs are linked with the application
at run time, not when you link the application files using the linker
(LINK). Linking a library with an application at run time is called dynamic
linking; linking a library with an application using the linker is called
static linking.


1.3  How the Windows Pieces Fit Together

Windows requires device drivers for the hardware on which it runs,
regardless of whether you are running Windows in real, standard, or 386
enhanced mode and in real or protected mode. Additionally, when you are
running enhanced Windows, it may also require a virtual device.

There are differences between the purpose of a Windows device driver (used
with the real, standard, and 386 enhanced mode versions) and that of an
enhanced Windows virtual device (used only with Windows when running in 386
enhanced mode). A Windows device driver exists to perform actions on its
device, such as printing a circle or getting the mouse location. It maps an
idealized device API onto limited real devices. Most enhanced Windows
virtual devices exist to support the multitasking of virtual machines by
serializing access to the hardware; it does not normally provide an API or
services to programs or device drivers. Instead of mapping a general API
onto specific devices, it simply traps and virtualizes all access to that
device.

Explanations of the three modes of Windows and how to write or modify the
appropriate driver or virtual device for your hardware are provided in Part
1, "Writing Windows Device Drivers," in this guide and in Part 3, "Writing
Virtual Devices," in the Microsoft Windows Virtual Device Adaptation Guide.



1.4  How Long Will it Take to Write a Device Driver or Virtual Device?

The development cycle depends on a number of factors, including whether or
not you are modifying an existing driver and the complexity of the interface
to the hardware. If you are developing an enhanced Windows virtual device,
you must also factor in at least two to three weeks to learn all about the
enhanced Windows architecture and environment.

If you have already written a Windows device driver and simply want to make
it compatible with Windows 3.0 when running in protected mode, modifying
and/or writing the necessary code should take only a few weeks. If your
device driver is simple and only does I/O and Windows function calls, any
changes will be minor and can be done in a week.

If the device is complex and not similar to one of the Microsoft-supplied
device drivers, the effort could take several months or longer.

You will need to do additional work to develop an enhanced Windows virtual
device (VxD) if the hardware can be accessed from non-Windows programs as
well as from Windows. Displays, serial communications, pointing devices, and
parallel printer ports all fall into this category. The VxD serializes
access to the hardware so that program output from the various programs that
are running does not get mixed together. Additionally, a VxD can handle
time-critical events, such as asynchronous data transfer, more efficiently
than a Windows device driver. Therefore, for running under enhanced Windows,
you may want to move that functionality out of the device driver and into
the VxD. However, the driver still needs the functionality to run under
Windows in real or standard mode.

Writing a VxD for serializing access to a piece of hardware will take a week
or two. Building additional functionality into a VxD for asynchronous data
transfer will take a couple of weeks longer than the time it takes to
implement the code for doing the actual data transfer.

If you are writing an enhanced Windows virtual device for a piece of
hardware that is only slightly different from one of the standard supplied
virtual devices, it should take only a few weeks. However, virtual devices
for completely different video adapters or displays may take several months
to write.


1.5  Core Windows Modules That Interface With Your Driver

Windows has several machine-independent modules that take control of your
computer's resources and maintain the user interface for application
programs. Microsoft develops these Windows modules, and they are ready for
use with your computer. For more detailed information on them, see the
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit.

The following modules form the heart of Windows:

                                  other display devices.

KERNEL.EXE                        Controls and allocates all the machine
                                  resources for use with Windows. It works
                                  with your computer's operating system to
                                  manage memory, load the applications, and
                                  schedule the execution of programs and

1.6  Other Modules in the Windows Environment

In addition to the core Windows modules (i.e., GDI, KERNEL, and USER), there
are other modules including device drivers that are necessary to complete
the basic Windows environment that you define in your SYSTEM.INI file. Each
module is designed to support a unique function within the system.

The following are brief descriptions of each of these main modules and
device drivers:

                                  device cursor.

FIXED.FON                         Contains the 2.x system font resources
                                  (for compatibility).

NETWORK.DRV                       Supports networks (optional).

OEMFONTS.FON                      Contains terminal font resources for
                                  running non-Windows applications.

                                  speaker.

SYSTEM.DRV                        Supports the system timer, information
                                  about system disks, and access to
                                  OEM-defined system hooks.

286GRABBER                        Supports data exchange between non-Windows
                                  applications and Windows in real and
                                  standard mode.



The above generic filenames are reserved. Therefore, do not name your
display driver DISPLAY.DRV. Instead, use a unique descriptive name with the
.DRV extension. For example, the EGA display driver provided with Windows is
called EGA.DRV. Or you can identify the vendor and device with a name such
as V7VGA.DRV for the VideoSeven(tm) VGA driver.

Other optional drivers that can make up part of the system include printer
and network drivers. Since these drivers are optional, their names are not
reserved. However, we recommend that you name your driver to represent your
device appropriately, for example, PSCRIPT.DRV for a PostScript printer
driver or MSNET.DRV for an MS-Network driver. For more details on the
various device drivers, see the appropriate chapter in this manual and the
Microsoft Windows Installation and Update Guide for the DDK.

In 386 enhanced mode, certain virtual devices (VxDs) are also needed to
complete the Windows system in this mode. For example, you might need some
of the following:


  ■   Virtual Display Device (e.g., VDDEGA.386)

  ■   Virtual Mouse Device (VMD.386)

  ■   Virtual Keyboard Device (VKD.386)

  ■   Virtual Comm Device (VCD.386)

  ■   Virtual Hard Disk Device (VHD.386)


For more details on and a complete list of the devices available, see the
Microsoft Windows Virtual Device Adaptation Guide and the Microsoft Windows
Installation and Update Guide for the DDK.


1.7  Windows Calling Conventions

You can write Windows device drivers in assembly language or in a Microsoft
high-level language. Windows requires specific segment name and calling
conventions that all Microsoft high-level languages and MASM provide.
However, assembly language programmers should use the CMACROS assembly
language macro package since it will provide them with these conventions
automatically. They can also use MASM 5.1 and later versions, which also
provide some built-in high level language features. (See Section 1.8, "How
to Use the INCLUDE Files," for details on using the CMACROS INCLUDE file.
See also the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Programmer's
Reference for further details.)

Windows uses the following convention to call and return from a device
driver function:


  ■   The called driver's code segment (CS) must not be larger than 64
      kilobytes. Drivers can depend on the code segment to remain in any
      fixed position in physical memory if it is declared as fixed in the
      .DEF file.

  ■   Whenever you write code that calls a device driver exported function,
      your code must execute the standard Windows prolog shown in the sample
      code that follows this description. The cProc/cBegin macro pair does
      this automatically for you. The standard Windows prolog sets the DS
      (data segment) register to point to the called function's DGROUP
      (which must not be larger than 64K).

      If declared as fixed in the .DEF file, the data segment is not moved
      and can be depended on to remain in place. A device driver can save
      data in its data segment in one function with full confidence that it
      will not be lost or modified by other parts of Windows.

      However, while it is fixed from the point of view of the owning code,
      it may not be so in the view of code outside of Windows. That is, it
      might be swapped out to disk or banked in EMS. Therefore, special
      measures must be taken by code that will be called by memory-resident
      software.

      However, the data segment can also be written to be moveable to allow
      for more flexible allocation of memory space. Drivers need to be as
      small as possible to ensure sufficient memory space for applications.

  ■   When mapping screen fonts into high EMS, the fonts are locked into
      memory only when they are actually being used. With large-frame EMS,
      they are mapped into high EMS, causing the mapping out of any
      discardable code currently occupying the space. Once the font is
      locked down, the integrity of any discardable code cannot be
      guaranteed, and the global heap is invalidated, making it impossible
      to load any new discardable code. Therefore, for drivers that use
      GDI's raster fonts, all the font/text operations in the ExtTextOut,
      StrBlt, GetCharWidths, and possibly RealizeObject functions need to be
      in a fixed segment.

  ■   The SS register points to the caller's (i.e., application's) stack
      segment, which will be different from the driver's data segment.
      Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), such as device drivers, do not have
      their own stack segment. They use whatever stack is available (i.e.,
      the application's stack).

  ■   The called function must save and restore any of the following
      registers that it uses: SS, SP, BP, SI, DI, and DS. However, if you
      use CMACROS.INC, the BP and DS registers are automatically saved and
      restored.

  ■   The direction flag must be cleared when exiting any function that sets
      or modifies it. The DS, SI, and DI registers must also be preserved.

  ■   A function call's code must place returned values in AX if they are
      16-bit, and in DX:AX if they are 32-bit.

  ■   Use FAR calls in your code to reach all the exported entries into a
      function. Each exported entry must execute a FAR return.

  ■   The cEnd macro generates the proper epilog code (if necessary) and the
      return instruction.

  ■   At the time of the call, all parameters for the entry are present on
      the stack, with the last parameter closest to the stackframe pointer,
      and the others at offsets deeper in the stack. Thus, CALL
      OEMFUNC(arg1, arg2, arg3) is implemented:

      push   arg1
      push   arg2
      push   arg3
      call   far  OEMFUNC


      The entry and exit code in the OEMFUNC function is as follows:

      OEMFUNC  PROC   far
        mov   ax,  ds ;Windows prolog support
        nop
        inc   bp
        push   bp
        mov   bp,  sp
        push   ds
        mov   ds,  ax
        sub   sp,  &lt;# bytes of local stack space&gt;
        push   si
        push   di
      ;
      ;  Now let's get the parameters off of the stack:
      ;
        mov   ax,  [bp+A] ;now AX contains arg1
        mov   bx,  [bp+8] ;similarly, BX contains arg2
        mov   cx,  [bp+6] ;puts arg3 into CX
        ...
      ;
      ;  Body of routine here. ;
        ...
        pop   di
        pop   si
        sub   bp,  2
        mov   sp,  bp
        pop   ds
        pop   bp
        dec   bp  ;Windows epilog support
        ret   # bytes of parameter space, in this case 6
      OEMFUNC  ENDP

  ■   All pointer arguments are passed as 32-bit quantities, occupying two
      WORDs on the stack. The segment portion is pushed first, then the
      offset portion. This allows you to use the LDS or LES instructions to
      retrieve pointers from the stack.



1.8  How to Use the INCLUDE Files

When writing assembly language graphics drivers, you will need to
incorporate at least the following INCLUDE (.INC) files, which can be found
in either the SDK or DDK. See the Microsoft Windows Installation and Update
Guide for the DDK for a list of the files provided with this kit.


  ■   CMACROS.INC

  ■   GDIDEFS.INC

  ■   WINDEFS.INC


Some of these contain both C and ASM definitions and, therefore, can also be
used in drivers written in C. Some of the other INCLUDE files provided with
the DDK are WINDOWS.H and SPOOL.H, which is used by printer drivers.


1.8.1  CMACROS.INC

The most important INCLUDE file is CMACROS.INC, which contains a set of
assembly-language macros that were written to be compatible with the
Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) v5.1. CMACROS.INC provides a simplified
interface to the function and segment conventions of high-level languages,
such as C and Pascal.

You must include this file at the beginning of the assembly-language source
file by using the INCLUDE directive. You must also give the full pathname if
the macro file is not in the current directory or in a directory specified
on the command line.

The C macros are divided into the following groups:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Group                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Segment macros                    Give access to the code and data segments
                                  that an application can use without any
                                  special definition. Medium-, large-, and
                                  huge-model applications can define
                                  additional segments by using the createSeg
                                  macro. These segments have the names,
                                  attributes, classes, and groups required
                                  by Windows.

Storage-allocation macros         Allocate static memory (either private or
                                  public), declare externally defined memory
                                  and procedures, and allow the definition

                                  and procedures, and allow the definition
                                  of public labels.

Function macros                   Define the names, attributes, parameters,
                                  and local variables of functions.

Call macros                       Can be used to call cProc functions and
                                  high-level language functions. These
                                  macros pass arguments according to the
                                  calling convention defined by the ?PLM
                                  option, which is defined in the file with
                                  the Cmacros.

Special-definition macros         Inform the C macros about user-defined
                                  variables, function-register use, and
                                  register pointers.

Error macros                      Allow assertions to be coded into an
                                  assembly-language source program. This

                                  sequences for some operations based on the
                                  variable allocation or bit position of a
                                  flag in a WORD, and assert that the
                                  assumptions made are true. They also
                                  generate an error message to the console
                                  and an error message in the listing. Both
                                  the text that caused the error and the
                                  result of its evaluation are displayed in
                                  the generated error message.



In other words, the C macros take care of many of the housekeeping tasks
necessary for setting up stack frames, calling between modules written in C
and those written in assembly language, and defining local and global
variables.

Since the CMACROS.INC file has no comments in it, this section will include
explanations of some of the functions that you will use in a Windows device
driver. For information on the other functions, detailed descriptions of
syntax, and individual examples, see the chapter on Assembly-Language Macros
in the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit.


Setting Up Stack Frames

How to set up stack frames is the first concept to be discussed. Graphics
device drivers are always called from the device-independent Windows
graphics device interface (GDI). GDI passes the parameters for each drawing
command to the device driver on the stack. (All calls from GDI are FAR
calls.) When the driver is called, the parameters for the call have been
pushed onto the stack at offset ss:[bp+6]. By using the C macros, you can
automatically retrieve these parameters in a clear and easily documented
way. Otherwise, you must refer to these parameters by offsets from
ss:[bp+6], which can quickly become confusing. For more information on
calling conventions, see the Mixed Language Programming Guide included with
the MASM documentation.

The following is a skeleton of the Bit Block Transfer (BitBlt) assembly
language file showing how CMACROS.INC is used typically in a device driver.

   localV Local20BytesofData,20

  |
  cEnd
  ;
  ;
  sEnd Code
  end

If you have questions on any of the terms used in the skeleton example, see
the chapter on Assembly-Language Macros in the Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit. Several C macros features will also be discussed here in
more depth.


Keywords

WIN and PASCAL, as used on the cProc line, allow you to overrule the ?PLM
and ?WIN flags. In the skeleton example, they are redundant. However, the
sample drivers included in the DDK sometimes use them, and they are
certainly harmless.

You can also use NODATA as a keyword in the cProc line. Normally, the prolog
and epilog code set the DS register to point to the default data segment
whenever the process type is FAR. However, this is sometimes wasteful and
can result in an unwanted destruction of the AX register since AX is used to
set up DS. Therefore, you can use the NODATA keyword to prevent the prolog
and epilog code from modifying DS. For example:

  cProc EnableCursor,&lt;FAR,PUBLIC,WIN,PASCAL,NODATA&gt;,&lt;es&gt;


Case Sensitivity

If you are assembling your program using MASM's case sensitivity switch
(-Ml), some of the names documented in the Assembly-Language Macros chapter
of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit will not work. Make sure
that you use the following syntax for the default segment names:

  Code  Data  Stack

and:

  CodeOFFSET DataOFFSET StackOFFSET

Also notice that the arg command should be in lower case.


Defining Multiple Modules

There are some easier ways to define multiple modules using the same stack
frame. For example, take the case in which a BitBlt process, like the one
shown in the skeleton example, should really be logically divided into two
modules. One would contain hardware-independent code and the other would
contain hardware-dependent code. However, both of them still need to share
the same variables that are passed on the stack and defined as variable
names by C macros. In such cases, some programmers would use the following
calling sequence in module one:

  arg lpDestDev
  arg DestxOrg
  arg DestyOrg
  etc . . .
  cCall BitBltModuleTwo

and the following receiving sequence in module two:

  cProc BitBltModuleTwo&lt;FAR,PUBLIC,WIN,PASCAL&gt;
   parmD lpDestDev
   parmW DestxOrg
   parmW DestyOrg
  etc . . .
  cBegin

However, this inter-module calling sequence is extremely wasteful in terms
of setting up the stack frame in both the caller and the FAR call. Instead,
the C macros allow you to create a dummy cProc header in all the modules
that will share the same stack frame (except, of course, the calling
module). Then, use the &lt;nogen&gt; qualifier on the cBegin line. C macros will
create the equates for the stack frame but will not generate any code in the
dummy process. After that, you can make NEAR calls to any subprocesses
without any wastefulness, as shown in the following example:


In File 1:

  externNP  Module2
  ;
  cProc Module1,&lt;FAR,PUBLIC,WIN,PASCAL&gt;,&lt;si,di&gt;
   parmD Param1
   parmW Param2
   parmB Param3
  cBegin
  |
  | some code.
  |
  cCall Module2
  |
  |
  |
  cEnd


In File 2:

  cProc ModuleFamilyDummy,&lt;FAR,PUBLIC,WIN,PASCAL&gt;
   parmD Param1
   parmW Param2
   parmB Param3
  cBegin &lt;nogen&gt; ;don't generate any code─just equate stack
    ;offsets for the parameters to symbolic names
  cEnd &lt;nogen&gt; ;don't generate any code─just end the process
  ;
  ;
  cProc Module2,&lt;NEAR,PUBLIC&gt;
  ;
  cBegin
  ;
  ;Now Module2 will be able to use the same stack frame variable as
  ;Module1. The far call has been avoided as well as the pushing of the
  ;stack frame in Module1.
  ;
  cEnd


1.8.2  GDIDEFS.INC

GDIDEFS.INC enables you to refer to symbolic constants and structures by
their Windows standard names, which is good practice. To shorten the
assembly time and cross-reference lists, you can selectively include parts
of GDIDEFS.INC by defining equates that tell the assembler which parts to
include. These equates are listed as follows:

╓┌──────────────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Equate             Definition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
incLogical equ 1   Includes logical pen, brush, and font definitions
incDevice equ 1    Includes the symbolic names for GDIINFO definitions
incFont equ 1      Includes the FONTINFO and TEXTXFORM definitions
incDrawMode equ 1  Includes the DRAWMODE data structure definitions
Equate             Definition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
incDrawMode equ 1  Includes the DRAWMODE data structure definitions
incOutput equ 1    Includes the output style constants
incControl equ 1   Includes the escape number definitions



1.8.3  WINDEFS.INC

WINDEFS.INC contains two very useful macros that are used to turn off
hardware interrupts such as those from the floppy and hard disk controllers,
math coprocessor, timer, keyboard, and mouse. Use the EnterCrit and
LeaveCrit macros whenever you do not want an asynchronous interrupt to
reenter an area of code that Windows is executing.

Using the mouse interrupt as an example, it is possible for the mouse to
generate interrupts faster than your mouse-handling code can process them.
Therefore, it is likely that Windows could be updating a mouse coordinate
when another mouse coordinate came along to be serviced. Due to this
succession of interrupts, special care must be taken to  prevent any loss of
mouse actions.

To manage this situation, when you are about to update your mouse
coordinates, use the EnterCrit macro. This will stop the mouse interrupts
from occurring. After you get the new mouse coordinates, then you can use
the LeaveCrit macro to reallow interrupts. Do not use simple CLI and STI
instructions to accomplish this since they will not correctly restore the
states of the flags and interrupts.






Chapter 2  Display Drivers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Microsoft Windows 3.0 display drivers provide the interface necessary to
obtain device independence between the Windows environment and the display
hardware. The driver gives information to Windows and Windows applications
on color resolution, screen size and resolution, graphics capabilities, and
other advanced features that may be available on the hardware. This
information is then used by the applications to create the desired screen
output.

The display driver interacts with the graphics device interface (GDI), which
in turn is called by the application to perform a variety of output
operations. All the graphics functions described here are called by GDI.

This chapter and Chapter 3, "Display Drivers: New Features," describe the
support you need to provide in your Windows display driver. Of course, the
extent of the support you provide depends on the type of hardware supported.
However, you need to implement all the defined structures and functions that
are applicable to your device. When you do so, Windows applications will be
able to take full advantage of Windows' capabilities and of your hardware
device.

The DDK includes sample code for display driver sources. These provide you
with examples of how the following functions are used by Windows to display
output to the screen:


  ■   Output

  ■   Enable and Disable

  ■   RealizeObject

  ■   ColorInfo

  ■   BitBlt

  ■   StrBlt/ExtTextOut

  ■   Control


The functions are listed here and described in the following sections in the
order in which we recommend you implement them after filling out the GDIINFO
data structure. A few additional functions that you need to implement are
also briefly described here. These can be done in any order after
ExtTextOut. Detailed descriptions of all these functions are provided in
Chapter 10, "Common Functions."

The chapter ends with a discussion on display driver resources and how to
build the resource file. A checklist is also included summarizing the main
points made in the chapter.


2.1  Basic Information

A Windows display driver is a Windows dynamic-link library (DLL) that
implements a set of standard graphics primitives for a particular display
device. The display driver essentially translates the device-independent GDI
interface into a stream of display commands and data.


2.1.1  The GDI Interface

GDI's interface to a display driver is much simpler than an application's
interface to GDI, since GDI takes care of all the coordinate
transformations, object management, and most clipping. There is, however, an
analogy between the two sets of functions.

Applications that call GDI functions draw into GDI device contexts. A device
context (DC) is GDI's device-independent virtualization of the output
device, be it the display, a printer, a memory bitmap, or even a metafile
not associated with any specific device.

When GDI creates a device context, the display driver is asked to supply
information about the display, for example, the resolution of the device and
the number of colors. In addition, the display driver is asked to create its
own internal state information about the device. The device-dependent state
(referred to as the physical device structure or PDEVICE) corresponds to the
DC at the driver level.

The application can request information about the device context, for
example, to determine what fonts are available. GDI will call the driver to
supply device-specific information. GDI will supply the driver with the
PDEVICE structure that corresponds to the DC the application is using.

Another portion of GDI deals with managing drawing tools or objects, such as
pens, brushes, and fonts. For the most part, GDI manages these objects
itself. However, when the application uses one of the objects to create
output, GDI asks the driver to create a device-specific representation of
the object.

When an application performs output to a particular DC by using the graphics
functions, GDI will first perform any necessary transformations and, then,
call the driver to perform that output into the corresponding physical
device. GDI can also simulate complex graphics, such as filled polygons,
with simpler driver primitives.


2.1.2  New for Windows 3.0

Two new graphics concepts were added to Windows 3.0: device-independent
bitmaps (DIBs) and color palettes. DIBs provide a device-independent way for
applications to transfer bitmap images among a variety of devices. As a
minimum, all display drivers should support SetDIBits(), GetDIBits(), and
SetDIBitsToDevice(). These and other DIBs functions are discussed in more
detail in Chapter 3, "Display Drivers: New Features."

Color palettes are used on devices that have a high color resolution but
cannot display all the colors simultaneously (i.e., a device with 6 bits of
resolution-per-color plane but with the ability to display only 256 colors
simultaneously). More information about color palette support can also be
found in Chapter 3, "Display Drivers: New Features."


2.2  Filling Out the GDIINFO Data Structure

The first step toward producing a successful Windows display driver is to
fill out properly the GDIINFO data structure. (You can find the file for
this data structure in your model driver.) The GDIINFO data structure tells
Windows about the capabilities of your device. It also tells Windows
applications how to expand and contract their bitmaps to achieve a WYSIWYG
appearance on your display. To ensure a consistent-looking display, you must
follow exactly the calculations in this section.

The GDIINFO data structure is organized as shown in the following table. All
the entries are WORDs (2 bytes). Most of the items will be discussed in
greater detail in subsequent sections. For additional information on GDIINFO
from a printer driver's viewpoint, see Chapter 5, "Printer Drivers."

2.2.1  Screen Metrics

The screen metrics entries include such items as width and height in
millimeters. These values are closely related to the screen resolution,
aspect, and fonts that you want to use. This section provides examples of
how to do these various calculations.

Windows provides the following raster fonts:


  ■   Courier - a fixed-width font with serifs in the ANSI character set

  ■   Helv - a proportional-width font without (sans) serifs in the ANSI
      character set

  ■   Tms Rmn - a proportional-width font with serifs in the ANSI character
      set

  ■   Symbol - a representation of math symbols in the Symbol character set

  ■   System - a proportional-width font without serifs in the ANSI
      character set

  ■   Fixed System - the Windows 2.0 fixed-width system font in the ANSI
      character set

  ■   Terminal - a fixed-width font with serifs in the OEM character set


For more information on the ANSI, OEM, and Symbol character sets, see
Chapter 15, "Miscellaneous Character Set Tables."

Windows also currently provides the following six versions of these screen
and system fonts. All the filenames have the same .FON extension.


  ■   COURA, HELVA, TMSRA, SYMBOLA, CGASYS, CGAFIX: for a 2 to 1,
      low-resolution device such as the CGA display. (Actual pixels per inch
      = 96 in X and 48 in Y.)

  ■   COURB, HELVB, TMSRB, SYMBOLB, EGASYS, EGAFIX: for a 1.33 to 1 device
      such as the EGA. (Actual pixels per inch = 96 in X and 72 in Y.)

  ■   COURC, HELVC, TMSRC: for a 1 to 1.2 device. (Generally used for
      printing devices.) (Actual pixels per inch = 60 in X and 72 in Y.)

  ■   COURD, HELVD, TMSRD: for a 1.66 to 1 device. (Generally used for
      printing devices.) (Actual pixels per inch = 120 in X and 72 in Y.)

  ■   COURE, HELVE, TMSRE, SYMBOLE, VGASYS, VGAFIX: for a 1 to 1 device such
      as the VGA display. (Actual pixels per inch = 96 in X and 96 in Y.)

  ■   COURF, HELVF, TMSRF, SYMBOLF, 8514SYS, 8514FIX: for a 1 to 1 device
      such as the 8514/A display. (Actual pixels per inch = 120 in X and 120
      in Y.)




Pixels Per Inch

For the Windows font mapper to match one of these default fonts to your
display, you have to "fix" the numbers used in the various screen metrics
entries. First, you must decide on what numbers to use in the two entries,
"Pixels per inch in X" and "Pixels per inch in Y," which are offsets 88 and
90 in the structure. You should fill in the two entries with the "actual
pixels per inch" numbers given in the above-mentioned list of fonts to
ensure that your device can display these fonts. For example, if the target
display card has square pixels, use the closest entry for the "E" fonts or
"F" fonts and put a 96 or 120 in offset 88 and a 96 or 120 in offset 90 of
the data structure.


Width and Height in Millimeters

Once you have determined the "logical" pixels per inch, you can easily
calculate the width and height of the screen in millimeters. The equation
for calculating the width in millimeters is as follows:

You can similarly calculate the height in mm as follows:

Feel free to round off these values to even numbers.


The Metric, English, and TWIP Windows and Viewports

Some Windows application programs rely on these numbers to produce printer
output with spacing that is proportional to the screen. By using these
numbers, an application could show a border or graphic picture that will be
proportionately the same size on the printer as it is on the screen.

You must keep all these ratios the same because it might be preferable for
an application to use the metric system rather than the inches/feet
(English) system for its calculations. For example, Windows Write allows the
user to choose whether to express the border widths in millimeters or
inches. Therefore, it is up to the device driver to provide the correct
numbers.

The Metric Lo-Res Window and Viewport consist of four WORD-length entries:

Offset             Value
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
48                 Width in mm * 10
50                 Height in mm * 10
52                 X-resolution in pixels
54                 - (Y-resolution in scanlines)

The Metric Hi-Res Window and Viewport consist of four WORD-length entries:

Offset             Value
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
56                 Width in mm * 100
58                 Height in mm * 100
60                 X-resolution in pixels
62                 - (Y-resolution in scanlines)

The English Lo-Res Window and Viewport consist of four WORD-length entries:


Offset           Value
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
64               Width in mm * 1,000
66               Height in mm * 1,000
68               X-resolution in pixels * 254
70               - (Y-resolution in scanlines * 254)

The English Hi-Res Window and Viewport consist of four WORD-length entries:


Offset           Value
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
72               Width in mm * 10,000
74               Height in mm * 10,000
76               X-resolution in pixels * 254
78               - (Y-resolution in scanlines * 254)

The TWIP (a printer's point = 1/72 of an inch) Window and Viewport consist
of four WORD-length entries:

Offset           Value
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
80               Width in mm * 14,400
82               Height in mm * 14,400
84               X-resolution in pixels * 254
86               - (Y-resolution in scanlines * 254)

Notice that Windows performs a WORD-length, signed calculation on these
windows and viewports. Therefore, you cannot calculate numbers greater than
32K (32,768). However, if your screen is larger than just a few inches wide,
you will exceed this limit when you start calculating the English windows
and viewports and may even exceed it on the Metric windows and viewports.
Fortunately, you can simply scale down the calculated values by dividing
them by some fixed amount. You must use the same amount to divide the "width
in mm and X-resolution" and the "height in mm and Y-resolution."

For example, assume the following results to your TWIP calculation:

Width in mm = 280 Height in mm = 210 X-resolution = 1024 Y-resolution = 768
280 * 14,400 = 4,032,000 = Width in mm 210 * 14,400 = 3,024,000 = Height in
mm 1024 * 254 = 260,096 = X-resolution - (768 * 254) = - 195,072 =
Y-resolution

A divisor that gives you a number

A divisor that gives you a number

Therefore, the numbers that you should put in your GDIINFO data structure
are as follows:

4,032,000 / 512 = 7875 = Width in mm 3,024,000 / 384 = 7875 = Height in mm
260,096 / 512 = 508 = X-resolution - (195,072) / 384) = -508 = Y-resolution



The X and Y Aspect Ratios

These metric calculations are based on the aspect ratios that you must know
for your display cards. That is, you must know whether your display card has
a 1:1 aspect ratio (square pixels), a 1.33:1 aspect ratio (such as the EGA),
or some other aspect ratio. You figured this out when you chose which font
metric to use. Now you must find whole numbers that are less than 100 and
that produce a whole number hypotenuse when put through the Pythagorean
theorem equation. The equation is as follows:

a2 + b2 = c2

Where c2 is the hypotenuse.

For example, if you use 10 for both a and b when you have a square pixel
display, then you will get the following:

102 + 102 = 200

The square root of 200 rounded to a whole number is 14. Therefore, for this
example, you would put the following:

X aspect (offset 40) = 10 Y aspect (offset 42) = 10 Hypotenuse of X and Y
aspect (offset 44) = 14

The following is an example for a 1.33:1 display. If you choose 48 for the
X-aspect and 38 for the Y-aspect, then the calculation will give a
hypotenuse (rounded to a whole number) of 61.


The Length of Patterned Line Segments

The final metric calculation is for the length of patterned (also known as
styled) line segments. This is simply calculated as follows:

2 * Hypotenuse

Windows uses this number to make the patterned lines that it draws into
bitmaps and onto displays appear correct and consistent on different
displays and printers.


2.2.2  Bit Planes and Bits Per Pixel

The EGA and VGA drivers included in this kit are planar in nature.
Therefore, put the number 4 in the "Number of Planes" (offset 14) entry.
This means that they have 4 planes and are capable of 16 true, non-dithered
colors (two colors per plane to the fourth power = 16). They should also
have the number 1 in the "Bits Per Pixel" (offset 12) entry.

Many of today's more sophisticated displays allow you to draw onto them
using pixel color values, i.e., to write all of their planes in one pass.
These devices are called packed pixel devices and include the 8514/a and
TI(R) 34010-based devices.

The "Number of Planes" entry for an 8-bit per pixel driver is 1. However,
the "Bits Per Pixel" entry in the structure has the number 8, which
indicates that it takes 8 bits (one byte) to represent each pixel on the
display. Therefore, such a device is capable of displaying 28 = 256 colors
on the screen.

The number of planes and bits-per-pixel also define the bitmap format that
the device driver must understand. See Chapter 12, "Data Structures and File
Formats," for more information on the BITMAP data structure.

Some display devices allow addressing of the board in either planar or
packed pixel mode. However, it may be more efficient for both you and
Windows to use the packed pixel mode whenever possible. For more information
on the sources included in the DDK that show the use of this packed-pixel
mode (i.e., the Video Seven VGA and the 8514/a, see the Microsoft Windows
Installation and Update Guide.


2.2.3  Supported Capabilities and the Output Function

Now you must decide what capabilities you want your driver to support. You
will need to decide on which shapes you will choose to draw using your
device's hardware. Windows' only requirement is that you be able to draw
solid or patterned single-pixel-wide horizontal lines (scanlines) and solid
single-pixel-wide lines in any direction (polylines).

However, it may be faster for you and produce better results if you use your
display's advanced hardware to draw such shapes as circles, ellipses, and
alternate-fill polygons. The Curves, Polylines, and filled figure
(Polygonal) capabilities allow you to tell Windows that you want it to call
your Output function to give you a chance to draw the figure with your
hardware.

Remember, though, that the most important concept of the Windows display
driver interface is whatever you do on the screen, you must also be able to
do into a main (host) memory bitmap.

Some displays support many of the complex drawing functions that Windows
allows the driver to support. For example, assume there is a certain display
device that supports all sorts of patterned line drawing with any width of
line. Normally, the device driver writer would register all of these
capabilities into his GDIINFO data structure and, then, write a polyline
routine with a physical pen that supports wide and styled lines. Everything
seems to work well. The writer then runs some of the applications included
in this kit and everything works really fast.

Unfortunately, Windows requires the same abilities (the ability to write
wide and styled polylines) for drawing into an arbitrary main memory bitmap.
The device driver writer would have to duplicate all of his board's wide and
styled line drawing capability into an 8086 routine running on the PC. Not
only is this quite often a huge task in terms of the algorithm, but it also
makes the device driver unnecessarily large. Therefore, the device driver
writer should often allow GDI to support the more complex pen styles and
widths, even though there is a sacrifice of some speed when drawing with
these pens.

Windows 2.0 and later versions give you flexibility in supporting Output
shapes. Assume that you can draw a polygon with 256 vertices but not with
257. Or, that you can draw ellipses to your screen but do not wish to
duplicate the algorithm for ellipse drawing into main memory bitmaps
(Windows, however, requires that any figure you claim you can draw onto the
screen must also be able to be drawn to a main memory bitmap).

You then say that you have the ability to draw polygons and ellipses. When
your driver's Output function is called, you can have it return a failure
return code (-1) and have Windows synthesize the figure for you with the
basic building blocks (scanlines, solid polylines, and pixels).

The following is a list of the Output function's capabilities and their
corresponding offset numbers. These will be discussed in greater detail in
the following subsections.


  ■   Curves (offset 28)

  ■   Polyline Drawing (offset 30)

  ■   Polygonal Drawing (offset 32)

  ■   Text Drawing (offset 34)

  ■   Clipping (offset 36)

  ■   Miscellaneous Raster/BitBlt (offset 38)



Curves (Offset 28)

The following table shows what you can draw when you set each bit:

╓┌──────────────┌────┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Value          Bit  Capability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CC_CIRCLES     0    Circles
CC_PIE         1    Pie wedges
CC_CHORD       2    Chord arcs
CC_ELLIPSES    3    Ellipses
CC_WIDE        4    Wide, solid-curved borders around curve figures
CC_STYLED      5    Patterned lines surrounding curves
CC_WIDESTYLED  6    Wide, patterned-curved borders around curve figures
CC_INTERIORS   7    Can fill the interiors of curves
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

All other bits in the WORD should be set to zero. If the driver doesn't
support curves, all bits should be set to zero.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Windows can use an ellipse to draw a circle if circles are not supported by
the driver. If your device can fill the ellipse, then you should set the
interiors bit. Windows can also use an alternate-fill polygon to draw wide
borders (both solid and patterned) just as efficiently as if the driver
supported them correctly.


Polyline Drawing (Offset 30)

The following table shows what you can draw when you set each bit:

╓┌──────────────┌────┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Value          Bit  Capability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
LC_POLYLINE    1    Polylines (all display drivers must set this bit)
Value          Bit  Capability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
LC_POLYLINE    1    Polylines (all display drivers must set this bit)
LC_MARKER      2    Reserved
LC_POLYMARKER  3    Reserved
LC_WIDE        4    Wide lines
LC_STYLED      5    Patterned lines
LC_WIDESTYLED  6    Wide patterned lines
LC_INTERIORS   7    Can fill the interiors of wide lines
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

All other bits in the WORD should be set to zero. If the driver doesn't
support any line capabilities, all bits should be set to zero.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

If you support styled lines, make sure that the lengths of the line segments
that your hardware draws are the same as those at offset 46 (dpStyleLen) of
GDIINFO. Also, if you support wide or styled polylines, you must support
them to both main memory bitmaps and to your screen.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

If you decide to support styled lines, you must support them to both main
memory bitmaps and screen bitmaps. This is because Windows will not let you
return a failure from Output for any of the line styles.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

If your hardware supports styled and wide lines, it is probably worth the
effort to implement them, even though they are used rather infrequently.
However, Windows also does a fine job of synthesizing them by using pixel
draws, which are slow but work. (In the sample drivers, wide lines are not
supported, but styled lines are.)


Polygonal Drawing (Offset 32)

The following table shows what you can draw when you set each bit:

╓┌──────────────┌────┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Value          Bit  Capability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PC_POLYGON     0    Alternate-fill polygons
PC_RECTANGLE   1    Rectangles
PC-TRAPEZOID   2    Winding number fill polygons
PC_SCANLINE    3    Scanlines (all display drivers must set this bit)
PC_WIDE        4    Wide borders around polygonal figures
PC_STYLED      5    Patterned borders around polygonal figures
PC_WIDESTYLED  6    Wide patterned borders around polygonal figures
PC_INTERIORS   7    Can fill the interiors of polygonal figures
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

All other bits in the WORD should be set to zero. If the driver doesn't
support polygons, all bits should be set to zero.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Again, we do not recommend supporting wide borders since Windows will use
alternate-fill polygons (i.e., the kind that most hardware supports) to
produce these borders.

However, we do recommend patterned border support if the hardware supports
it. Great speed increases are possible with polygonal patterned borders.


Text Drawing (Offset 34)

The following table shows what you can draw when you set each bit. The bits
marked with an asterisk (*) are the ones you should set (if your device has
the capability).

╓┌────────────────┌────┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────►

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────




Clipping (Offset 36)

If your hardware device can "scissor clip" to a rectangular region, then you
should put a 1 here and support clipping in your driver's Output function.

This capability is used only by Windows to determine whether or not you can
clip Output shapes. Text must be clipped to a pixel boundary by the driver
no matter what is placed in this field.

Output, StrBlt (ExtTextOut), BitBlt, SetDIBitsToDevice, and UpdateColors
(for palatte-capable devices) are the only functions that require any
clipping.


Miscellaneous Raster/BitBlt (Offset 38)

Many of these capabilities are required for displays.

Since FastBorder shares a bit with the ExtTextOut capability, you must set
the bit. However, you can return a failure code from FastBorder for which
Windows will compensate. The 8514/a driver does this.

The following table shows what you can draw when you set each bit. The bits
marked with an asterisk (*) are required for display drivers.

╓┌────────────────┌────┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────►

2.3  The Enable and Disable Functions

The following are the call parameters for Enable and Disable:

  cProc  Enable,&lt;FAR,PUBLIC,WIN,PASCAL&gt;,&lt;si,di&gt;
   parmD   lpDestDev
   parmW   Style
   parmD   lpDestDevType
   parmD   lpOutputFile
   parmD   lpData


  cProc  Disable,&lt;FAR,PUBLIC,WIN,PASCAL&gt;,&lt;si,di&gt;
   parmD   lpDestDev

GDI calls the Enable function twice for display drivers. The first time, the
passed variable is Style = 1. This means that GDI wants you to move your
GDIINFO data structure into the area pointed to by lpDestDev. You must
return, in the AX register, the size in bytes (= sizeGDIINFO) of your
GDIINFO data structure.

The second time (with Style = 0), three things must occur. These last two
steps are discussed in more detail in the following sections. First, you
must initialize your graphics-board hardware to be ready to run Windows.
Then, you must initialize any other hardware and copy the PDEVICE structure
to the area pointed to by lpDestDev.


2.3.1  Initializing Your Other Hardware

Next, you should perform any initialization of your other hardware. You do
not need to clear the screen at this time (however, some prefer to do so).
Windows will call BitBlt to do that for you.

While initializing, you must call a special function (INT 2FH) to make your
Windows driver work in the OS/2 Compatibility Box and 386 enhanced mode
Windows. Because Windows is graphic in nature and because the cursor
operates asynchronously from the rest of Windows, you must be sure to leave
and reenter Windows in an orderly fashion when switching in and out of the
Compatibility Box.

When you switch back into the Compatibility Box, you reinitialize your
hardware and call Windows to repaint the screen. OS/2 and 386 enhanced mode
Windows use the INT 2FH function 4001H (Notify Background Switch) to switch
from the Compatibility Box to OS/2, and function 4002H (Notify Foreground
Switch) to switch back into the Compatibility Box. (See the following
subsections for descriptions of these functions.)

OS/2 uses or recognizes the following INT 2FH functions:

╓┌───────┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────╖
Number  Name                              Made by
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4000H   Enable VM-Assisted Save/Restore   Display driver
4001H   Notify Background Switch          Display driver
4002H   Notify Foreground Switch          Display driver
4003H   Enter Critical Section            Display driver
4004H   Exit Critical Section             Display driver
4005H   Save Video Register State         OS/2
4006H   Restore Video Register State      OS/2
4007H   Disable VM-Assisted Save/Restore  Display Driver
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


The Enable function must hook INT 2FH and check each call to that interrupt
to see if it is one of the above-mentioned functions. You hook the interrupt
by using the following MS-DOS functions: 35H to get the old vector and 25H
to set the new vector. Be sure to save the address of the old interrupt.

You should look at the SSWITCH.ASM file in one of the sample drivers to see
how INT 2FH is hooked. Notice that you must hook INT 2FH, even when running
under versions 3.x or 4.x of MS-DOS, because many network systems (including
MS-NET) that are running under a "real mode" MS-DOS will want to use the
same functionality that OS/2 uses. See the following subsections and
Appendix D, "Windows INT 2FH API," in the Microsoft Windows Virtual Device
Adaptation Guide for more detailed information.

However, before you hook INT 2FH, you must get the address of a special
function in the Windows USER module that forces a repaint of the entire
screen. This is because when you switch back from OS/2 to Windows, which is
running in the Compatibility Box, you must restore the screen to the state
in which it was when you exited. Fortunately, the USER module's function can
do this automatically for you.

To get the address for this special function, first call the Windows
function GetModuleHandle. This returns a special identifier to the USER
module called a handle.

Once you have the handle to the module, you call the Windows function
GetProcAddress, giving the special process identifier for the repaint
function (this identifier is always the number 275 decimal). GetProcAddress
returns to you a long pointer to the repaint function, which you then save
and call when appropriate. However, when the USER module is in a critical
section and is not ready to process the repaint function, it calls the
UserRepaintDisable function in the display driver with a flag byte parameter
value of TRUE. In this case, the display driver should postpone calling the
repaint function until the USER module calls the UserRepaintDisable function
with a flag value of FALSE.

The following subsections provide descriptions of the INT 2FH functions
mentioned in this discussion on switching in and out of the OS/2
Compatibility Box. Notice that, in all the functions, all the registers are
unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise and the interrupt flag can be
modified. Also, when a display driver is processing an INT 2FH call issued
by OS/2, INT 21H and INT 31H operations are not allowed but ROM BIOS
operations are for video functions only.


INT 2FH/AX=4000H - Enable VM-Assisted Save/Restore

A Virtual Machine (VM) application (such as Windows) can issue this call
when it is initializing to determine what level of virtualization the
Virtual Display Device (VDD) supports and to disable I/O trapping of
unreadable registers whenever this VM is in the foreground. The VDD instead
relies on the VM's INT 2FH support to save and restore the VM's register
state (see functions 4005H and 4006H). If this capability is enabled, the
VDD returns in AL a non-zero value, which may be one of the following:

    001H - No modes virtualized in background 002H - Only text modes
    virtualized in background 003H - Only text and single-plane graphics
    modes virtualized 004H - Only text, single-plane, and VGA multiplane
    graphics modes virtualized 0FFH - All supported video modes virtualized

The state of the video adapter at the time this call is made will be the
state restored prior to Notify Foreground Switch (function 4002H) and
requests by Restore Video Register State (function 4006H). Also, video
memory is no longer saved across screen switches; it is the application's
responsibility to completely reinitialize video memory after a Notify
Foreground Switch request.


INT 2FH/AX=4001H - Notify Background Switch

The VDD issues this call to a VM that is being unconditionally switched to
the background. Once this call is complete, the VM can continue to run.
However, if it accesses video memory while in an unvirtualized video mode,
it will be frozen until brought to the foreground again. The VM must return
from this call within 1000ms; otherwise, the screen switch will proceed
anyway.

It is expected, though not required, that an application that has enabled
VM-Assisted Save/Restore (function 4000H) will not access video memory or
registers after this notification, to avoid being frozen in a video mode
that cannot be virtualized. However, any application that does so can still
be detected and frozen if the operation cannot be virtualized. When
VM-Assisted Save/Restore is not enabled, the VM's registers and memory are
completely saved after this call has returned (or timed-out).


INT 2FH/AX=4002H - Notify Foreground Switch

The VDD issues this call to a VM that is being unconditionally switched to
the foreground. The VM can assume that it once again has complete access to
the physical display hardware. No time-out is enforced on this call.

If the VM has enabled VM-Assisted Save/Restore, it is now expected to
reinitialize completely the video memory. The state of the adapter will
already be restored to the state that existed when function 4000H was
issued. If VM-Assisted Save/Restore is not enabled, the full state of the
adapter (memory and registers) will already be restored, and this call need
not be acted upon.

Under certain error conditions, this notification may be issued without a
corresponding Notify Background Switch (function 4001H); an example is the
critical section time-out, discussed in the following two subsections.


INT 2FH/AX=4003H - Enter Critical Section

A VM application (such as Windows) issues this call whenever it is in a
critical section and consequently cannot respond to a Save Video Register
State request (function 4005H). When a Save is required and the VM is in a
critical section, the required operation is postponed for up to 1000ms or
until the Exit Critical Section call (function 4004H) is made, whichever
comes first. If time-out occurs, then the VDD reprograms the hardware anyway
and, when its operation is complete, initiates the Notify Foreground Switch
request (described earlier in this section), in an attempt to reinitialize
the application properly.


INT 2FH/AX=4004H - Exit Critical Section

A VM application (such as Windows) issues this call when it has completed
its critical section processing. Each Exit Critical Section must be preceded
by an Enter Critical Section or the request is ignored.


INT 2FH/AX=4005H - Save Video Register State

The VDD issues this call when it requires access to the video hardware
registers (e.g., for a full-screen Clipboard copy operation). The VM
receiving this call must save any data necessary to restore effectively its
video state when a Restore Video Register State request (function 4006H) is
issued later. The VM must return this call within 1000ms; otherwise, the
required operation will proceed anyway.

This call is issued only if the VM has enabled VM-Assisted Save/Restore (see
function 4000H). It is not issued prior to Notify Background Switch calls
(function 4001H); it is issued only at times when the hardware must be
reprogrammed for what are essentially brief and non-visible operations.


INT 2FH/AX=4006H - Restore Video Register State

The VDD issues this call when it relinquishes to a VM the access to the
video registers. The VM receiving this call should restore any register
states necessary to continue uninterrupted foreground operation. No time-out
is enforced on this call.

This call is issued only if the VM has enabled VM-Assisted Save/Restore (see
function 4000H). Whatever registers the VDD modified are restored to the
state saved at the time of function 4000H. In other words, before this call
is issued, every register is guaranteed to be either unchanged or reset to
the state at the time of function 4000H; precisely which registers may be
reset is undefined, but the set is restricted to those Sequencer and
Graphics Controller registers that do not affect the display.


INT 2FH/AX=4007H - Disable VM-Assisted Save/Restore

A VM application (such as Windows) issues this call when it is terminating
to re-enable I/O trapping of unreadable registers whenever this VM is in the
foreground. The INT 2FH functions that save and restore the VM's register
state (functions 4005H and 4006H, defined earlier in this section) are no
longer issued for this VM, and the enter/exit critical section services
(functions 4003H and 4004H, also defined earlier) are ignored. The Notify
Background Swith and the Notify Foreground Switch INT 2FH calls (functions
4001H and 4002H) may still be issued.


2.3.2  Copying Your PDEVICE Data Structure

The last thing to do while in your Enable function is to copy the PDEVICE
structure you want to the area pointed to by lpDestDev. This call to Enable
should return a 1 in AX if all was successful. Otherwise, it will return a
0.

The PDEVICE data structure defines so-called physical objects rather than
bitmaps, and is used solely by the device driver. Therefore, the contents of
this data structure are normally determined by the device driver writer.

The PDEVICE structure has only one WORD-length field that is required by
Windows. That field is the first WORD in the structure and must be non-zero.
This number will be put into the first WORD of any BITMAP data structure
(always pointed to by the lpDestDev parameter passed in the call) that
Windows asks the device driver to draw onto the device.

If the bitmap is to be drawn into a "main memory" bitmap, the first WORD of
the BITMAP data structure will always be 0. In this way, the device driver
can tell where to draw the bitmap.

All the other fields in the PDEVICE structure may or may not be used by the
driver in whatever way it wants to.

The "bitmapped" displays (such as the CGA and VGA) duplicate a BITMAP data
structure into the PDEVICE structure. This is because, in most cases, their
drawing functions work exactly the same for drawing onto the device as they
do for main memory draws.

In the case of high-resolution (non-bitmapped) devices, you probably only
need to use the required first WORD of the PDEVICE structure. Since PDEVICE
is passed to you on almost every call, you may just want to store some
appropriate states in it. This is totally up to you.


2.3.3  Comments on the Disable Function

This is a simple function. When the Disable function is called, first return
your device to the state in which it was when you started Windows. Then, set
the video mode to mode 3 or 7, depending on the display adaptor used before
Windows was started, and unhook yourself from INT 2FH. Notice that trapping
is no longer needed.

The Disable function is called whenever the Windows graphics mode is about
to terminate, i.e., whenever the user wants to leave Windows or switch to a
non-Windows application running in full-screen mode.

The Disable function is not called when switching in and out of the OS/2
Compatibility Box (OS/2 takes care of hardware reinitialization). When
returning from a non-Windows application, the Enable function (with Style =
0) is called.

Over a non-Windows application call and during the "switch-out" from the
Compatibility Box to OS/2, your driver's Data segment will be saved intact.
Other segments will be thrown out. Therefore, your driver should treat
accordingly any data that it needs to have saved. Also, your Enable process
should reinitialize any flags relating to screen states since these will
probably be destroyed by the exit to the non-Windows application.


2.4  The RealizeObject Function

This function is used to create physical objects (e.g., pens, brushes, and
device fonts) for exclusive use by the device driver.

Hardware rarely uses the exact same representation of a Windows object that
Windows does. For example, it is inconvenient for the IBM(R) 8514/a display
adapter to deal in terms of RGB 24-bit colors. It prefers to look at colors
as 8-bit quantities. However, the most device-independent way for an
application to pass down its desired color is by using the RGB
representation.

The RealizeObject function is where the translation between
device-independent (or logical) and device-optimal (or physical) objects
takes place.

But why not simply use GDI's logical objects and translate them into
device-optimal objects at the actual time of drawing? The answer is that GDI
tries to be economical. It stores many pretranslated objects and might use
this same object in hundreds of different draws. The translation is done
only once for many draws.


2.4.1  Background Information

The Windows graphics device interface (GDI) is a device-independent graphics
drawing engine. It communicates with a Windows application through the
Windows application programming interface (API), which is documented in the
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit. The GDI then calls your device
driver to translate its device-independent graphics order into a real
picture on a screen or printer page.

Windows recognizes three types of objects at the device driver level:


  ■   Pen

  ■   Brush

  ■   Font


The pen is used to draw polylines and borders around objects drawn by the
Output function. It has three attributes:


  ■   Color

  ■   Style (or pattern, such as dotted lines)

  ■   Width


The second object is called a brush (or pattern). This object is used to
fill figures drawn by Output, and to fill (with some logical operation)
rectangular areas drawn by BitBlt.

For example, the rectangular areas that make up a Windows screen are all
drawn by BitBlt using a brush. The brush has the following attributes:


  ■   Pattern (an 8-pixel by 8-pixel repeating block pattern)

  ■   Color(s)

  ■   Hatch (predefined patterns that use an explicit foreground and
      background color that is assigned to them)


The last object is the font that is used to draw text by the StrBlt and
ExtTextOut functions. Display drivers generally use GDI to realize fonts and
so should fail with an error return code of zero if asked to do so. However,
if they have their own fonts, they can use RealizeObject to realize those
fonts.


2.4.2  The Pen Object

The logical pen has the following structure:

╓┌──────────┌───────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Value      Offset  Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lopnStyle  0       Pen style

lopnWidth  2       Width of pen in pixels
            4      Height of pen in scanlines

lopnColor  6       RGB pen color (doubleword: high byte is 0)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Value      Offset  Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────



The following are the possible styles that can be passed in offset 0 of the
logical pen structure:

╓┌──────────────┌───────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Value          Style code  Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
LS_SOLID       0           Solid line
LS_DASHED      1           Dashed line
LS_DOTTED      2           Dotted line
LS_DOTDASHED   3           Dot-dashed line
LS_DASHDOTDOT  4           Dash-dot-dotted line
LS_NOLINE      5           NULL. Draw no line.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Be sure to support the NULL style in your drawing code. If you get a pen
with this style, you should draw no line and return a success code.

You might want to not support wide and/or styled lines. If you do support
them, you must make sure that you support the same styling algorithms when
drawing to the screen and main memory. However, GDI is able to synthesize
correctly both wide and styled lines quite efficiently. Therefore, you may
not want to support them in your first pass and add their support later only
if necessary. To do so, just set the correct bits in your GDIINFO data
structure to tell Windows that you do not support wide and/or styled lines.


Under certain conditions, GDI may pass you a logical pen with a wide or
styled line, even if you have told GDI that you do not support them. In that
case, realize the pen into a physical object with a solid, one-pixel wide
(nominal) pen. GDI will be smart enough to still do the styling and
wide-line activities itself.

The physical pen structure may be anything that you like. You may want to
put special case flags into the physical pen to communicate special case
drawing enhancements to the actual drawing routines.


2.4.3  The Brush Object

The logical brush has the following structure:

╓┌──────────┌───────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────►
Value      Offset  Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lbStyle    0       Brush style (0=Solid, 1=Hollow, 2=Hatched, 3=Patterned)

lbColor    2       For solid brushes: RGB color (high byte = 0)

                   For hatched brushes: RGB foreground color (high byte = 0)

                   For palette-capable devices, if the high byte is 0FFH,
                   then the low WORD is an index and not an RGB

                   For patterned brushes: pointer to pattern BITMAP
                   structure

Value      Offset  Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

lbHatch    6       Hatch style (not used for other brush styles)

lbBkColor  8       Physical color for hatch background (not RGB. See Section
                   2.5, "The ColorInfo Function," for a description.)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────



────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Note

In the case of a patterned brush, the bitmap passed can be either a
monochrome or, for color devices, a color bitmap. Monochrome patterns are
assigned the color index to use (for ones and zeros) at the time when the
output operation is called. The text and logical color passed in the
DRAWMODE structure are to be used for that conversion.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You should realize hollow brushes. If they are passed to a drawing routine,
no fill should be done at all. However, if the raster operation that is
passed to BitBlt is NOT Destination, you should logically NOT the entire
rectangular area passed, even if the passed brush is hollow.

Solid brushes can be dithered. If your Style is solid and does not match
exactly the color that you have in your palette, then you probably want to
dither it. For an example of how to dither, refer to the sample code
included with the DDK.

The following are the possible hatch styles that can be passed in offset 6
of the logical brush structure:

╓┌──────────────┌───────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Value          Style code  Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
HS_HORIZONTAL  0           Horizontal (──)
HS_VERTICAL    1           Vertical (||||)

2.4.4  Using the RealizeObject Parameters

The following are the call parameters and return values for the
RealizeObject function:

  cProc  RealizeObject,&lt;FAR,PUBLIC&gt;
   parmD  lpDestDev
   parmW  Style
   parmD  lpLogicalObj
   parmD  lpPhysicalObj
   parmD  lpTextXForm (or WindowOrigin)

Returns:

    If lpPhysicalObj = 0, it returns the size required for a physical object
    in AX.

    If lpPhysicalObj &lt;&gt; 0, it returns 1 if successful and zero if
    unsuccessful.

It is important to understand how to use the RealizeObject parameters. When
your display is called, you must first determine whether the caller (GDI)
actually wants you to realize an object, or if it is asking for how much
space to allocate for the realized (physical) object.

If GDI is asking for the size of the physical object, the parameter
lpPhysicalObj will be zero. You then return in AX the size (in bytes) of
your physical pen, brush, or font. If you do not support the realization of
fonts, simply return a zero.

If GDI is asking you to realize a logical object into a physical one,
lpPhysicalObj will be pointing to the memory location where you must put
your completed physical object, and lpLogicalObj will be pointing to the
logical object that GDI wants you to translate.

The Style parameter tells you whether or not you are to realize a pen (=1),
brush (=2), or font (=3). You would then do the translation and return AX=1
as a success code or AX=0 as a failure code. For example, if you do not
support the realization of fonts, you would return AX=0.

The lpTextXForm parameter is "dual-purpose." If you are asked to realize a
font, it is a pointer to the TEXTXFORM data structure. (See Chapter 13, "The
Font File Format," for more information.)

If you are asked to realize a brush or patterned pen, this parameter is not
a pointer. It is actually a POINT structure with the starting coordinates in
X and Y of the window in which the application (the one that called GDI) is
running.

Therefore, it is essential to establish a pattern reference point. Most
displays use a pattern reference point starting at the same location as the
starting point of the draw. In other words, for an 8-bit repeating pattern,
the first bit of the pattern is at the X-origin of the draw. Then, at the
X-coordinate (X-origin+8), the pattern begins to repeat itself.

During BitBlt, the pattern reference point must be at the beginning of the
window in which the application is running. Therefore, you must rotate any
patterns so that they begin their repetition relative to the application's
window. If you do not rotate them, you run the danger of the patterns not
"meshing" if a part of the client area is repainted later using the same
brush.


2.5  The ColorInfo Function

The following are the call parameters and return values for the ColorInfo
function:

  cProc   ColorInfo,&lt;FAR,PUBLIC&gt;,&lt;si,di&gt;
   parmD  lpDestDev
   parmD  ColorIn
   parmD  lpPhysicalColor

Returns:

    If lpPhysicalColor is NULL, DL:AX will contain the RGB color
    corresponding to the physical color passed in ColorIn. DH must be zero
    for non-palette capable devices. In the case of a non-system palette
    index being passed, DH returns 0FFH and AX returns the palette index.

    If lpPhysicalColor is not NULL, DL:AX contains the RGB value of the
    device's color that most closely matches the color passed in ColorIn. DH
    must be zero for non-palette capable devices. In the case of a
    non-system palette index being passed, DH returns 0FFH and AX returns
    the palette index.

The next step in writing your device driver is the ColorInfo function. This
function is closely related to RealizeObject since it deals with
translations between logical colors, which are passed as doubleword RGB
values, and physical colors, which are those recognized and used most
readily by your device. However, for palette-capable devices only, if the
high byte is 0FFH, then an index (WORD) is passed and not an RGB color. In
that case, the passed color index is copied as is into the physical color
object.

Since the RealizeObject function also requires the translation from logical
to physical colors when creating physical pens and brushes, you may have
already written most of this function when you wrote the RealizeObject
function. Simply follow the instructions found above and in the description
for the ColorInfo function given in Chapter 10, "Common Functions."

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

The high byte of any doubleword RGB color returned by your device driver
must be zero for non-palette capable devices.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


2.6  The BitBlt Function

BitBlt is perhaps the most important function used in Windows. You might
want to implement it first so that you can go into the debugger and watch
Windows take shape on your screen. It is BitBlt that actually draws on the
screen the rectangles that comprise the Windows desktop. It also draws the
icons and other bitmaps, but not the cursor.

When Windows first starts up, the following occurs:


  1.  Enable is called twice.

  2.  ColorInfo is called a number of times.

  3.  RealizeObject is called to create the default Windows pens and brushes
      (black solid pen, white solid pen, black brush, white brush, etc.),
      the brushes needed to draw the desktop, and the brushes needed to draw
      and fill the Program Manager window.


Notice that no pens are used and that no Polylines or Scanlines are drawn.
BitBlt and ExtTextOut do all the drawing on this screen. Therefore, these
are the only two drawing functions that you need to implement to see your
driver start up Windows. You can write stub functions for all the rest.

The first thing that BitBlt draws is the screen background. To do this, it
uses the PatCopy raster operation to draw a rectangle.

Next, BitBlt draws a number of borders and rectangles, also using various
brushes that you already realized.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

When debugging your driver for the first time, it is a very good idea to set
SYMDEB or WDEB386 breakpoints at ColorInfo, RealizeObject, and BitBlt so
that you can see how brushes are realized and used in Windows.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Lastly, BitBlt puts up the corner icons. These are bitmaps that are first
drawn to a main memory bitmap that is maintained by USER. This composite
bitmap is created using BitBlt during the early part of Windows
initialization. (This one bitmap contains all the  bitmaps that are part of
the driver's resources.) These bitmaps are then transferred to the screen.

The following are the call parameters for the BitBlt function:

  cProc  BitBlt,&lt;FAR,PUBLIC&gt;,&lt;si,di&gt;
   parmD  lpDestDev
   parmW  DestxOrg
   parmW  DestyOrg
   parmD  lpSrcDev
   parmW  SrcxOrg
   parmW  SrcyOrg
   parmW  xExt
   parmW  yExt
   parmD  Rop3
   parmD  lpPBrush
   parmD  lpDrawMode

The following sections discuss how to use each of the passed parameters for
BitBlt. Additional information on the function and its parameters is
provided in Chapter 10, "Common Functions."


2.6.1  lpDestDev, DestxOrg, and DestyOrg

The lpDestDev parameter is a long pointer to a PDEVICE data structure. If it
is a main memory bitmap (i.e., WORD 0 of the structure = 0), it will be a
BITMAP data structure. (See Chapter 12, "Data Structures and File Formats,"
for the documentation on these structures.)

If the destination is the device (i.e., screen, printer, etc., and WORD 0 of
the structure is non-zero), then the structure is whatever you defined the
PDEVICE data structure to be at Enable time. You should determine the
characteristics of the destination bitmap from this structure. Such things
as its color format, width, and height can be extracted from the structure.


Remember that the destination can be either a bitmap in main PC memory or
the device. There is always an lpDestDev passed to BitBlt.

The DestxOrg and DestyOrg parameters are the starting X and Y coordinates
for the draw on the destination bitmap (or device).

There are a number of calculations that you need to do if you are drawing
into a bitmap. Because the bitmap is arranged as a series of addresses
(called linear addresses), you must convert the X and Y coordinates into
these linear addresses. The sample source code provided with the DDK
contains an example of how to do this for a monochrome (1 bit-per-pixel)
bitmap. Notice that by varying the macro somewhat, you can do the
calculation for any color format.


2.6.2  lpSrcDev, SrcxOrg, and SrcyOrg

The lpSrcDev parameter may point to the source PDEVICE data structure or it
may be NULL. To determine whether or not this parameter means anything, you
must interpret the Rop3 parameter to see if a source is involved in the
block transfer.

If the Rop3 parameter does not include a source, then this pointer points to
NULL. If there is a source, this is the PDEVICE of that source.

Again, if the Rop3 parameter indicates that there is a source operand in the
block transfer, then the two parameters, SrcxOrg and SrcyOrg, will contain
the starting X and Y coordinates of the source of the block transfer. If
there is no source involved in the block transfer, these two parameters will
be ignored.

The BitBlt function must be able to handle negative values in SrcxOrg and
SrcyOrg (due to scaling done by GDI). Therefore, BitBlt needs to perform
clipping of the source with regards to the destination.


2.6.3  xExt and yExt

These are the width and height of the block transferring area. By adding
them to the X and Y origins and subtracting 1, you can get the ending
coordinates. Notice that these apply both to the source and the destination.



2.6.4  Rop3

This parameter is crucial to your understanding of BitBlt. (See Chapter 14,
"Raster Operation Codes and Definitions," for a list of the codes as well as
a detailed description of how to read Rop3 codes and reverse Polish
notation.)

The Rop3 parameter (known in the Microsoft Windows 2.0 Adaptation Guide as
Rop) is a ternary (three operand) raster operand. That is because there can
be three operands (i.e., source, destination, and pattern) involved in the
block transfer. The Rop3 parameter describes which of the three operands is
involved in the block transfer and what you must do with each operand. In
contrast, the Output and Pixel functions use a binary raster operation
(Rop2), which involves only the brush or pen and the destination. No source
is involved.

The first thing that you should do in your BitBlt function is to "decode"
the Rop3 parameter. What you must learn from the Rop3 code is the number of
operations to do in the block transfer, the operands involved, and the
actual operation script. For memory-mapped boards (those similar in
architecture to the CGA, EGA, VGA, and Hercules(R)), you can use the
prototype functions included in the sample drivers. For hardware such as the
8514/a or TI-34010-based boards, you should probably construct a table of
the 256 possible Rop3 parse strings, the number of operations involved in
the block transfer, and the operands involved.

In addition to the table of parse strings, you might also create a lookup
table so you can locate the given parse string for decoding the Rop3 and
other flags that are specific to the requested Rop3, such as an
operands-present flag.

You will then have taken all the information necessary for doing the block
transfer from the Rop3 parameter. By testing bits in the operands-present
flag, you can make determinations such as whether or not there is a source
or a brush involved, and whether or not the destination must be saved.

The concept of saving the destination is an important one. Assume you are
told to execute Rop3 code 8BH. Its reverse Polish string is DSPDxoxn. Its
parse string would be represented as follows:

  Rop8B  db OperationPattern+LogOpXOR ;this destroys the destination
   db OperationSource+LogOpOR
   db OperationDestination+LogOpXOR ;the destination has
       ;already been destroyed
   db OperationUnaryNOT  ;

This Rop3 could not be done unless the destination was saved from being
destroyed by the first operation. Therefore, in the operands-present flag,
you should reserve a bit that tells you that you must pre-save the
destination from destruction before you begin performing the block transfer.


The last Rop3 concept is actually a shortcut. As you can imagine, typing in
parse strings for all 256 Rop3s is quite tedious, not to mention the huge
memory requirement for all 256 parse strings and lookup table entries.
However, the Rop codes 128 through 255 are simply the Rop codes 0 through
127 with a NOT added on to the back. Therefore, you only need 128 parse
strings. If the Rop3 code is &gt;=128, you can add on a NOT to the end of the
Rop3 operation. Also, if the original Rop3 parse string ends with a NOT
operation, you can cancel the two NOTs and save two operations.

For example:

  Rop code 0FH is a NOT Pattern
  Rop code F0H is a Pattern copy

Since Rop F0H is normally &gt;128, you would take its inverse (0FH) and add on
a NOT to the end. However, since Rop 0FH has a NOT as its last operation,
the two NOTs cancel and F0H becomes a simple Pattern copy.


2.6.5  lpPBrush

If the Rop3 code indicates that a pattern is involved in the block transfer,
lpPBrush points to a PBRUSH structure that was realized in RealizeObject.

If there is a brush operand, it can be put onto the screen by simply drawing
a solid or patterned rectangle bounded by DestxOrg, DestyOrg, xExt, and
yExt.

If a hollow brush is passed to BitBlt, the brush portion of the operation
should not be done. However, all the other operations (such as Source and
NOT operations) must still be done.


2.6.6  lpDrawMode

The lpDrawMode parameter is used only for mono-to-color and color-to-mono
conversions. If your device is color, then Windows can ask you to convert a
monochome (1 plane, 1 bit-per-pixel) bitmap into a bitmap matching your
board's and driver's color format. The colors contained in the lpDrawMode
parameter (background color at byte offset 4 and foreground color at byte
offset 8 in the structure) allow you to do this conversion. The following
holds true:


  1.  Mono-to-color conversion:

      ■   Bits that are 1 in the monochrome bitmap become background color.

      ■   Bits that are 0 in the monochrome bitmap become foreground color.


  2.  Color-to-mono conversion:

      ■   Color pixels that match the background color map to 1.

      ■   Anything that does not match the background color is mapped to 0.



────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

Every color device must support the transferring of monochrome (Black/White)
bitmaps as well as color bitmaps to and from the screen.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Even though the lpDrawMode parameter has other fields such as OpaqueFlag (at
byte offset 2) and Rop2 (at byte offset 0), these are totally disregarded by
BitBlt. All block transfers are opaque no matter what the lpDrawMode
parameter says, and Rop3 is used instead of Rop2.


2.7  The StrBlt/ExtTextOut Functions

StringBlt (StrBlt) is the old Windows 1.x name for ExtTextOut. The two names
are now often used synonymously since StrBlt is used as an entry point to
the Extended Text Out (ExtTextOut) function. It is documented in more detail
in Chapter 10, "Common  Functions."

The function is still needed for compatibility with applications written for
Windows 1.x. However, only a few old applications still call StrBlt, while
most new ones do not. They are simply mapped by GDI to ExtTextOut. You will
need to put in only one piece of code (shown in Chapter 10, "Common
Functions") and then jump into ExtTextOut.

The following are the call parameters for the StrBlt function. They are the
same as the first nine parameters of the ExtTextOut function.

  cProc StrBlt,&lt;FAR,PUBLIC&gt;, &lt;si, di&gt;
   parmD lpDestDev
   parmW DestxOrg
   parmW DestyOrg
   parmD lpClipRect
   parmD lpString
   parmW Count
   parmD lpFontInfo
   parmD lpDrawMode
   parmD lpTextXForm

ExtTextOut is one of the text drawing functions. It works in conjunction
with BitBlt to do the drawing on the screen. To see your driver start up
Windows, all you need to implement are these two functions.

This function replaces the StrBlt function for Windows version 2.0 and
later. The following are the call parameters for the ExtTextOut function:

  cProc ExtTextOut,&lt;FAR,PUBLIC,WIN,PASCAL&gt;,&lt;si, di&gt;
   parmD lpDestDev
   parmW DestxOrg
   parmW DestyOrg
   parmD lpClipRect
   parmD lpString
   parmW Count
   parmD lpFontInfo
   parmD lpDrawMode
   parmD lpTextXForm
   parmD lpCharWidths
   parmD lpOpaqueRect
   parmW Options

The following sections provide supplemental information on how to use each
of the passed parameters for ExtTextOut. For more details, refer to the
description for this function given in Chapter 10, "Common Functions."


2.7.1  lpDestDev, DestxOrg, and DestyOrg

The lpDestDev parameter tells you what you are drawing onto. For displays,
this is the display device or bitmap.

The DestxOrg and DestyOrg parameters give the origins of the top-left corner
of the string on the destination device.


2.7.2  lpClipRect and lpString

The lpClipRect parameter is a long pointer to the clipping rectangle.

If your hardware does not support clipping, then it is the hardest part of
ExtTextOut. If you did not have to clip, then the ExtTextOut function would
be small and easy to implement. You would simply take each character's
bitmap from the Font bitmap, transfer it to the screen, and then expand it
for the number of bits-per-pixel and planes you have.

However, you must clip, and there are some rules to remember. One of them is
that for all clip rectangle or rectangle (RECT) data structures or
scanlines, the ending coordinates are always one greater than the actual
pixel number at which you are to stop drawing. Therefore, if the clip
rectangle has the coordinates 0, 0, 10, 10 (where the 0s are the starting X
and Y, and the 10s are the ending X and Y), you only draw pixels 0 to 9 and
do not draw through the 10th pixel.

The RECT data structure contains the following two points:

  RECT struc
   left dw O
   top dw O
   right dw O
   bottom dw O
  RECT ends dw O

Left and top are the coordinates that specify the upper-left corner of the
rectangle.

Right and bottom are the coordinates that specify the lower-right corner of
the rectangle with regards to the destination.

The lpString parameter is a long pointer to the string itself. Each
character in the string is a byte length.


2.7.3  Count

Count can have one of three meanings.

First, if Count is positive (i.e., greater than zero), then it is the number
of characters to display from the string.

Second, if Count is negative (i.e., less than zero), then you just return
the length of the string as if there were no clipping rectangle, the height
in DX, and the X-width in AX.

Third, if Count is zero, then check the Options flag. If the 2s bit is set
in the Options flag, then it infers that you have to draw an opaque
rectangle.

If lpOpaqueRect is zero (even if the Options flag is 2), do nothing and
return success.

If lpOpaqueRect is not zero, then you do the following:


  1.  Get the opaquing rectangle (described by lpOpaqueRect).

  2.  Intersect it with the clipping rectangle.

  3.  Intersect the rectangle with the surface of the destination device.

  4.  Check to make sure that the rectangle is valid.

  5.  Draw the opaquing rectangle.


In summary, if Count is zero, then it can infer one of two things: there is
nothing to do, so you can get out, or you should only draw the opaquing
rectangle pointed to by lpOpaqueRect.


2.7.4  lpFontInfo

This is a long pointer to the FONTINFO data structure and represents the
physical font in use. (See the FONTINFO data structure fields in Chapter 12,
"Data Structures and File Formats.") Notice that you can be presented with
characters that are not in the character set or do not fall within the range
of dfFirstChar to dfLastChar. In such a case, you should use the
dfDefaultChar field.


2.7.5  lpDrawMode and lpTextXForm

This is a long pointer to the DRAWMODE data structure that includes the
current text color, background mode, background color, text justification,
and character spacing. (See the DRAWMODE data structure in Chapter 12, "Data
Structures and File Formats.")

If the background mode (or Transparent/Opaque flag) is 1, then you draw the
string transparently. If it is 2, then you draw the string opaquely.

If the string is to be drawn opaquely (e.g., if the foreground color is red
and the background color is green), first draw the green and, then, draw the
red character on top of it. If it is to be drawn transparently, just draw
the red foreground and forget the background.

If there is a break character, use the text justification and character
spacing algorithm described below. As you are running the string (either
making the count or putting the string on the page), you should get the
TBreakExtra flag from the DRAWMODE data structure. If it is zero, then it is
not a justified string and you can disregard the information given here.
However, you must always add the CharacterExtra in the DRAWMODE data
structure to the width of the character.

If no justification is required, TBreakExtra will be set to zero. To enable
justification, GDI will set TBreakExtra and BreakCount to the desired
values. The other justification fields are evaluated using these values and
BreakErr is set to BreakCount/2+1.

It is expected that StrBlt will be implemented as described below, but any
implementation that spreads the excess pixels across the character breaks
satisfies the requirements of text justification.

  width = width of char
  if TBreakExtra &lt;&gt; 0 and char = BreakChar then
   width = width + BreakExtra
   BreakErr = BreakErr - BreakRem
   if BreakErr &lt;= 0 then
    width = width + 1
    BreakErr = BreakErr + BreakCount
   endif
  endif
  width = width + CharacterExtra move over by width

The lpTextXForm parameter tells you that, for example, if the driver can
embolden, then this is a bold font and you look up your font in there. See
Chapter 13, "The Font File Format," for a description of the TEXTXFORM data
structure.


2.7.6  lpCharWidths and lpOpaqueRect

If not NULL, then lpCharWidths is a long pointer to an array of WORDs. Each
WORD specifies the width from the start of the current character origin to
the next character origin.

For example, assume the first character is an A, the next one is a B, and
the normal width of A is 4 pixels. However, if lpCharWidths is 5, then you
would move the B over by one pixel. If lpCharWidths is only 3, then the B
would be almost on top of the A. Notice, though, that you cannot have a
negative character width. It would always be changed to zero since you
cannot go backward.

The lpOpaqueRect parameter, if not NULL, is a long pointer to the opaquing
rectangle. See the earlier discussion on the Options flag, given under the
Count parameter, for further information on the actions required by this
parameter.


2.7.7  Options

The Options parameter is an integer with bits set to indicate ExtTextOut
options. See the earlier discussion under the Count parameter for additional
information on this parameter.

Notice also that whenever the clipping or opaquing rectangles intersect,
those rectangles also need to be intersected with the bitmap to make sure
the boundaries of the clipping rectangle are within the confines of the
device's surface. You should look at the height and width of the bitmap
(which are in the BITMAP data structure at offsets 2 and 4) to make sure
that the clipping rectangle passed is intersected with those. That way, you
will get the smallest possible rectangle composed of the three items: the
bitmap, the clipping rectangle, and (if specified) the opaquing rectangle.


2.8  Stub Functions

The following are two stub functions to which you need to set up calls. They
are not currently supported in GDI and should always return a failure code.
However, they may be supported in the future. Simply copy verbatim the code
reproduced here to your driver and you will be finished with their support.

  cProc  SetAttribute, &lt;FAR, PUBLIC&gt;
   parmD  lpDestDev
   parmW  StateNum
   parmW  Index
   parmW  Attribute
  cBegin
  xor  ax,ax  ;always return AX = 0
  cEnd

  cProc  DeviceBitmap, &lt;FAR, PUBLIC&gt;
   parmD  lpDestDev
   parmW  Command
   parmD  lpBitmap
   parmD  lpBits
  cBegin
  xor  ax,ax  ;always return AX = 0
  cEnd


2.9  The MoveCursor and CheckCursor Functions

The MoveCursor function moves the cursor to the given screen coordinates.
However, that can be rather difficult if you do not have a hardware cursor
and have to move your own cursor on the screen when it is saved in memory or
cached on the board.

The following is a sample procedure showing how to move the cursor:


  1.  Clear the interrupt flags using the EnterCrit macro to stop hardware
      interrupts.

  2.  Obtain the X and Y coordinates for the position at which they want you
      to place the cursor. These are passed to you by USER.

  3.  Put them into a variable called UndoneXandY. Save this in case you are
      unable to draw the cursor because something else is happening.

  4.  Get the old X and Y coordinates.

  5.  Set a DrawBusy flag saying that you are busy drawing and the driver
      should not try to draw another cursor at this time.

  6.  Use the LeaveCrit macro to allow interrupts again.


If the DrawBusy flag is on, then you have the undone coordinates saved in
UndoneXandY. When you are able to draw again, you can then go ahead and do
it. Otherwise, you disable the old cursor and put the new cursor on.

A more complete description of this function is available in Chapter 10,
"Common Functions."


2.9.1  Excluding Cursors

Sometimes you may want to exclude or get rid of the cursor from the screen
before doing something like a BitBlt, StrBlt, or drawing function. Or you
may not want to read the cursor back when reading from the screen because it
is difficult and time consuming.

How do you tell where your cursor was or from what area to exclude it? Do a
check to see where the X and Y coordinates are and exclude them if they lie
within your exclude region.


  ■   For BitBlt, just disable the cursor within the rectangle that you are
      transferring.

  ■   For Output for Scanlines, exclude the whole scanline.

  ■   For Polylines, exclude the clip rectangle.

  ■   For Polygons, exclude the clip rectangle.

  ■   For Ellipse, Circle, Rectangle, and other drawing functions, exclude
      it from the bounding rectangle.

  ■   For StrBlt, exclude it from the bounding rectangle and/or the opaquing
      rectangle.


To make the cursor run smoothly for these excludes, just before you start
dealing with the board hardware, do the following:


  1.  Set the DrawBusy flag, which disallows cursor movement. MoveCursor,
      however, is still registering these movements.

  2.  Check out your exclude region.

      If the cursor falls within that exclude region, you exclude or turn
      off the cursor. That removes the cursor from the screen and restores
      whatever was there before.

  3.  Do your draw.

  4.  After you are finished with the draw, reset the DrawBusy flag.

  5.  See if the cursor was excluded.

      If it was not, just get out and you are finished.

      If it was, take UndoneX and UndoneY, which are the movements that were
      registered while you were in the process of drawing, and enable the
      cursor at those coordinates.



2.9.2  The CheckCursor Function

This function is called on every timer interrupt. It allows the cursor to be
displayed if it is no longer excluded. A description of this function is
available in Chapter 10, "Common Functions."

However, you can also have an UnexcludeCursor routine to restore the cursor.



2.10  The Control Function

The Control function is required for display drivers. However, they need to
support only the following two escapes:


  ■   QUERYESCSUPPORT

  ■   GETCOLORTABLE


Windows 2.x drivers also needed to support SETCOLORTABLE. However, for
Windows 3.0, that escape is no longer required due to color palette
management considerations. See Chapter 3, "Display Drivers: New Features,"
for more information on color palette management.

You will use QUERYESCSUPPORT to tell a calling application that you support
a subset or none of the Control subfunctions. For more detailed information
on escapes in general and complete descriptions of these escapes, see
Chapter 11, "Device Driver Escapes."


2.11  Additional Functions

Display drivers also need to include the following additional functions:

Functions."


2.12  How to Build Display Driver Resources

Display drivers contain most of the cursors, icons, and bitmaps that are
used by Windows. They are supplied by the display driver to account for the
aspect ratio and resolution of the display adaptor. Also, the definitions of
certain system parameters (e.g., default colors and border widths) are
supplied by the display driver. All of this information is supplied as
resources that are added to the driver by the resource compiler (RC.EXE).

Windows 3.0 has changed a number of these resources, most notably the
bitmaps required to implement the 3-D effect. We recommend that you use the
set of bitmaps supplied in the DDK that best matches the
resolution/capabilities of your display. Since many existing Windows
applications expect the old images to still exist, the driver must supply
these as well. See the DDK's Installation and Update Guide for a detailed
list of the required resources and for more information.

The resource file (.RES) is built from the following pieces:


  ■   A FONTS.ASM file that contains information about font stock objects.

  ■   A CONFIG.ASM file that contains information about default system
      colors, line widths, cursor/icon sizes, etc.

  ■   A COLORTAB.ASM file that contains the color table for Control Panel's
      Color Tuner dialog.

  ■   A set of icons, cursors, and bitmaps.

  ■   A .RC file that is used by the resource compiler to build the binary
      resource file (.RES).




2.12.1  Creating the FONTS.ASM File

The FONTS.ASM file tells Windows the characteristics of certain fonts that
Windows uses as stock objects.

This file also defines these same characteristics for the two fonts
minimally required to run such programs as Windows Write. These are the ANSI
fixed-pitch and variable-pitch fonts. Normally, you will not have to create
these fonts; you may use the ones supplied with Windows at the aspect ratio
closest to that of your display or other device.

The FONTS.ASM file consists of three data structures that describe these
same characteristics plus one for the Terminal font. Each data structure is
of type LOGFONT (see Chapter 12, "Data Structures and File Formats," for
more information on that structure). The order of the three LOGFONT
structures in the FONTS.ASM file must be as follows:


  1.  OEM font (of facename "Terminal")

  2.  ANSI fixed-pitch font

  3.  ANSI variable-pitch font



2.12.2  Creating the CONFIG.ASM File

The CONFIG.ASM file tells Windows about many of the default characteristics
of the screen, such as:


  ■   Desktop colors

  ■   Line widths, both horizontal and vertical

  ■   Scroll bar "thumb" sizes

  ■   Cursor and icon compression ratios


The following is a prototype CONFIG.ASM file:

  OEM segment public

  ;Machine dependent parameters

   dw ? ;Height of vertical thumb (in pixels)
   dw ? ;Width of horizontal thumb (in pixels)
   dw ? ;Icon horiz compression factor (can be 1 or 2)

   dw ? ;Cursor horz compression factor (can be 1 or 2)
   dw ? ;Cursor vert compression factor (can be 1 or 2)
   dw ? ;Reserved

2.12.4  Creating Icons, Cursors, and Bitmaps

ICBs acceptable for use by many display resolutions and aspect ratios are
provided in various subdirectories of the resource file directories on the
disks provided with the DDK. See the DDK's Installation and Update Guide for
detailed lists of the subdirectories.

If you want to create your own ICBs, you can do so by using the SDKPaint
application. In creating ICBs, you should meet the criteria given in the
following tables for cursor, icon, and bitmap files.

This first table provides a list of cursor resource names along with their
corresponding filenames and purpose. The last four cursors in the list are
no longer used by Windows, but must be provided for compatibility with
existing Windows applications that may expect them to be available.

2.12.5  Assembling and Linking FONTS.ASM, CONFIG.ASM, and COLORTAB.ASM

To create FONTS.BIN, CONFIG.BIN, and COLORTAB.BIN, follow this procedure:

  masm fonts;
  link fonts;
  exe2bin fonts;

(Substituting "config" and "colortab" for "fonts" as appropriate.)


2.12.6  Using RC to Create the .RES File

Once you have completed all the preceding steps, you must create a script
for the resource compiler/editor (RC). We recommend that you use a .RC file
from one of the resource file directories.

Issue the following command to compile your resources:

  rc -r filename.rc

where filename is the name of your RC script. The output from this operation
will be your completed .RES file.

Chapter 3  Display Drivers: New Features
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This chapter provides information on the new Microsoft Windows 3.0 features
that affect display drivers and how to work with them. These include the
following:


  ■   Color palette management

  ■   Protected-mode support

  ■   &gt; 64K fonts

  ■   Device-independent bitmaps


The information provided is specific to device drivers. For a more general
and in-depth discussion on each of these topics, see the Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit.


3.1  Color Palette Management

Display devices that are capable of displaying at least (and possibly more
than) 256 simultaneous colors out of a palette need to provide a color
palette management interface. (See the Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit for a complete description of color palette management.)

Color palette management requires the following functionality from the
driver:


  ■   An interface to get (read) and to set (write) the hardware palette

  ■   An interface to get/set the driver-maintained color translate table


Depending on the capabilities of your hardware, there will be some
additional requirements as explained in the following subsections.


3.1.1  The Hardware Palette Calls

For the get/set hardware palette calls, the following parameters are passed
to the driver in this order:

  cProc   SetPalette, &lt;FAR, PUBLIC, WIN, PASCAL&gt;
    parmW  nStartIndex
    parmW  nNumEntries
    parmD  lpPalette

The parameters passed have the following meaning:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
nStartIndex                       The zero-based (color) index into the
                                  palette Look Up Table (LUT) specifying
                                  where to put the first RGB triplet.
                                  Subsequent RGB triplets are placed in
                                  subsequent palette LUT entries (in
                                  increasing order).

nNumEntries                       The total number of entries to set in the
                                  device's hardware palette.

lpPalette                         A far pointer to the RGB colors to be set
                                  into the palette. They are stored as Red,
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  into the palette. They are stored as Red,
                                  Green, Blue, and Flags, occupying one
                                  doubleword. The flags have no meaning for
                                  the driver and should be ignored.



For a GetPalette call, the same parameters are passed but the driver fills
the RGB array pointed to by lpPalette. A zero should be written in the Flags
field.


3.1.2  Hardware Palette Initialization

When the hardware is enabled, the hardware palette should be initialized by
the driver. The initialization deals with two sections of the palette: the
static colors and the non-static colors.

Static colors refer to the unchanging system colors that remain in the
palette at all times and are used for old-style RGB support (see the
following section on the color translate table for more details). The number
of static colors to be used is specified in the dpPalReserved field in the
GDIINFO structure. (This number must always be even.) The colors are placed
in the hardware palette so that the first half is in the lowest entries, and
the second half is in the highest entries.

For Windows 3.0, 20 static colors should be set as follows:

lowest ten:

  db 0,   0,   0,   0 ; 0
  db 080h,0,   0,   0 ; 1
  db 0,   080h,0,   0 ; 2
  db 080h,080h,0,   0 ; 3
  db 0,   0,   080h,0 ; 4
  db 080h,0,   080h,0 ; 5
  db 0,   080h,080h,0 ; 6
  db 0C0h,0C0h,0C0h,0 ; 7
  db 192, 220, 192, 0 ; 8
  db 166, 202, 240, 0 ; 9

highest ten:

  db 255, 251, 240, 0 ; 10
  db 160, 160, 164, 0 ; 11
  db 080h,080h,080h,0 ; 12
  db 0FFh,0,   0,   0 ; 13
  db 0,   0FFh,0,   0 ; 14
  db 0FFh,0FFh,0,   0 ; 15
  db 0,   0,   0FFh,0 ; 16
  db 0FFh,0,   0FFh,0 ; 17
  db 0,   0FFh,0FFh,0 ; 18
  db 0FFh,0FFh,0FFh,0 ; 19

Notice that these colors consist of the 16 standard VGA colors and four
other special colors used by the Windows manager.

The non-static colors included in the hardware palette need not be
initialized yet. GDI will manage these and initialize them when needed.


3.1.3  The Color Translate Table

The driver has to maintain a color translate table to translate the logical
color indices, passed to it by GDI, into the actual physical color indices.
The color translation has to occur before any raster operation (ROP) is
performed (i.e., ROPs are always applied to physical colors).The following
data structures contain logical colors that may need to be translated to
physical colors before they can be used:

  lpDrawMode ;translate foreground (text) and background colors
  lpPen  ;translate pen color
  lpPBrush  ;(structure is device specific) translate all the
    ;color indices
  memory bitmaps ;translate all the bitmap bits

Notice that the application has to perform color translation only when the
physical device is involved. In other words, if a line is drawn into a
memory bitmap or a bitmap is block transferred (blt'ed) into another memory
device, no color translation is required. On the other hand, if a bitmap is
blt'ed to or from the screen into a memory bitmap or a line is drawn
directly onto the screen, color translation is required. In the case of a
block transfer from the screen to the screen (where the physical device is
both the source and destination of the block transfer), color translation is
not needed since all the color indices are already translated into physical
indices.

Color specifications are passed to the palette-managing display drivers in
two forms:


  ■   0xFF00iiii, where iiii is the index to use

  ■   0x00RRGGBB, which gives the explicit RGB color to use. Match this
      color as closely as possible among the 20 reserved colors. In the case
      of a brush, the color may be dithered with the 16 VGA colors.


Since the reserved colors will always have fixed indices, their logical and
physical indices will be identical.

Color translation hooks have to be placed in the following functions:


  ■   Output (translates pen, brush, and draw mode)

  ■   Pixel (translates pen)

  ■   ExtTextOut and StrBlt (translate draw mode)

  ■   BitBlt (translates brush, draw mode, and, if necessary, bitmap bits)



3.1.4  The Palette Translate Table

For the get/set palette translate table calls, a far pointer to an array of
indices (i.e., WORDs) of a size specified in dpPalColors is passed to the
driver for the logical-to-physical color index mapping (for more information
on dpPalColors, see Section 3.1.7, "Changes to GDIINFO"). In the case of
GetPalTrans, the driver copies its translate table into the array that GDI
passed to it.

The functionality for the SetPalTrans call is a little more complicated. If
the pointer to the color table is not NULL, the driver has to copy the
translate table into its own data segment and also has to construct an
inverse of the table it was passed. The inverse table is needed for block
transfers from the screen to a memory bitmap.

In constructing the inverse table, the driver may come across ambiguities
because different logical colors can map to the same physical color. It is
up to the driver to decide how to resolve these cases since the net result
will look the same no matter how such ambiguities have been resolved.

If the pointer to the color table is NULL, the driver needs to construct
identity translate tables. It can also set accelerator bits to bypass the
various translations outlined above. For BitBlt, bypassing color translation
results in substantial performance improvements.


3.1.5  DIBs with Color Palette Management

The color table for a device-independent bitmap (DIB) consists of WORD
indices to be used as the "colors" for the bitmap. For SetDIBitsToDevice,
they are physical indices; for SetDIBits, they are logical indices.

In the GetDIBits, SetDIBits, and SetDIBitsToDevice functions, the final
parameter, lpConversionInfo, provides information that is useful only for
palette-capable devices. However, all devices need to include this
parameter.

During a Get operation on a 256-color device, it provides a long pointer to
a translate table with the following results:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Bitcount                          Result
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1                                 A palette-sized array of bytes, each one
                                  either 00H or FFH during the Get. The
                                  array is used to determine if the index in
                                  the bitmap corresponds to a zero or a 1 in
                                  the DIB.

4                                 A palette-sized array of bytes, each one
                                  containing a value between 00H and FFH.
                                  Each index in the bitmap will map to the
Bitcount                          Result
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  Each index in the bitmap will map to the
                                  corresponding 4-bit values in the DIB.

8                                 lpConversionInfo will equal an identity
                                  table that can be ignored.

24                                A palette-sized array of DWORD values,
                                  each one containing the RGB value (and
                                  unused high byte) corresponding to the
                                  index in the bitmap.



On a palette-cabable device when the source bitmap is a monochrome bitmap,
GetDIBits passes in a translate table that has only two entries, instead of
256. Entry 0 has the color table index for black and entry 1 has the color
table index for white.

During a Set operation, this long pointer will contain something meaningful
only when setting from a bitmap with a bitcount of 24. It will then point to
some data maintained by GDI. For every RGB value in the DIB, the device will
call a function in GDI as follows:

DeviceColorMatch(RGBvalue, lpConversionInfo)

where RGBvalue is a DWORD containing the RGB value to be color matched (with
the high byte ignored).

This GDI function will then return an index to use to represent that color
in the device-dependent bitmap.


3.1.6  The UpdateColors Function

An UpdateColors function/entry point needs to be added to the driver for all
palette-capable devices. UpdateColors is called to redraw a region directly
in place and on screen using the translate table passed in this call. That
means that it performs read pixel (color index), translates a pixel's color
index, and writes the translated index back in place for all the pixels in
the region specified in the call.

The following parameters are passed:

  cProc   UpdateColors, &lt;FAR, PUBLIC&gt;
    parmW wStartX  ;starting column (in screen pixels)
    parmW wStartY  ;starting row (in screen pixels)
    parmW wExtX  ;X extent of region (in screen pixels)
    parmW wExtY  ;Y extent of region (in screen pixels)
    parmD lpTranslate ;array of words, phys-&gt;phys translate

The origin is assumed to be in the upper-left corner of the screen.


3.1.7  Changes to GDIINFO

To support palette devices, three WORD entries have been appended to the
GDIINFO structure, which is defined in GDIDEFS.INC:

  dpPalColors,  dw  ?,  ; total number of simultaneous colors
  dpPalReserved,  dw  ?,  ; # of reserved colors
  dpPalResolution,  dw  ?,  ; palette resolution (in bits) of video DAC

The number of reserved colors on the palette is always 20, with 16
corresponding to the VGA colors and 4 special colors. Half of the reserved
palette colors are placed at the beginning and half at the end of the
palette. (See the sample palette-device code provided with the DDK for the
exact colors to use.)

The driver also has to set the RC_PALETTE bit for the dpRaster entry in
GDIINFO (RC_PALETTE equ 0000000100000000b). When set, this bit means that
the driver can do palette management.

The driver's version number (dpVersion) must be updated to 0300H as well.


3.1.8  Ordinal Reference Numbers

The following is a list of the ordinal reference numbers of the entry points
required for color palette management support:

╓┌───────────────────────────────┌───────────────────────────────────────────╖
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SetPalette                      @22
GetPalette                      @23
SetPalTrans                     @24
GetPalTrans                     @25
UpdateColors                    @26


These lines go into the display driver's definition file under EXPORTS.


3.2  Protected-Mode Support

Windows 3.0 drivers have to be bimodal, i.e., they have to run in protected
mode as well as 8086 real address mode. (See the Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit for more information on Windows memory management.) To
enable the device driver writer to write into the code segment (normally not
allowed in protected mode) and to perform segment (actually selector)
arithmetic to advance in 64K blocks, some help from KERNEL is needed by
using some of the following functions:

╓┌───────────────────────────────────────┌───────────────────────────────────►
Function                                Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AllocSelector()                         Allocates and returns an uninitialize
                                        selector for the driver's use in AX.

FreeSelector(wSel)                      Frees a selector allocated by
                                        AllocSelector.

ChangeSelector(wSrcSel,                 Makes the destination selector the
wDestSel)                               same as the source selector, except
                                        that:
                                        DATA─&gt;CODE or CODE─&gt;DATA.

AllocCSToDSAlias(wSel)                  Creates a data selector alias for the
                                        code selector passed (returned in AX)

AllocDSToCSAlias(wSel)                  Creates a code selector alias for the

__AHIncr                                Performs selector/segment arithmetic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
__AHIncr                                Performs selector/segment arithmetic.
                                        This is an absolute value that has a

                                        and a selector to next selector
                                        increment in protected mode.

__GetWinFlags                           Returns information on the CPU and th
                                        mode in which Windows is running, suc
                                        as standard, real, or enhanced mode a
                                        well as which 80x86 processor you are
                                        using.



The following actions cause a general protection (GP) fault if you do them
while in protected mode:


  ■   Accessing (reading or writing) an array beyond its limit.

  ■   Having an offset wrap-around (going from 0FFFFH to 0 using a string
      instruction).

  ■   Loading an invalid selector into a segment register.

  ■   Updating code segment variables.

  ■   Doing segment arithmetic (except as described above) for selector
      registers.

  ■   Comparing segment (selector) registers to see which is lower in
      memory.

  ■   Using undocumented MS-DOS calls. Use Windows calls whenever possible.


It should be noted that loading a segment register or making a far call
takes substantially longer in protected mode. Therefore, you should minimize
changing selectors and the number of far calls, particularly in loops.


3.3  Greater Than (&gt;) 64K Font Support

The 2.x FONTINFO structure has been enhanced to support &gt;64K fonts in the
3.0 font format. The changes are as follows:


  ■   The version number of the fonts in the dfVersion field in the FONTINFO
      structure will now be either 0200H or 0300H.

  ■   The CharTable array in the FONTINFO structure now has 6 bytes per
      character. Each entry consists of a WORD followed by a DWORD. The
      first WORD is the width of the character. The following DWORD is the
      byte offset from the beginning of the FONTINFO structure to the
      character's bitmap. With 32-bit offsets, the size of the FONTINFO
      structure, including the bitmaps, is no longer limited to 64K.

  ■   Additional fields have been added to the FONTINFO header between
      dfDBFiller and dfCharOffSet.


For more information on the FONTINFO data structure, see the following two
chapters: Chapter 12, "Data Structures and File Formats," and Chapter 13,
"The Font File Format."

The following are changes that need to be made in the display driver code:


  ■   The driver must let GDI know that it can support &gt; 64K fonts. To do
      this, the driver must set the RC_BIGFONT (0000010000000000b) bit of
      the raster capabilities WORD in the GDIINFO structure. Once this is
      done, GDI will ensure that all the fonts that the driver gets to
      handle are in the new format. However, both formats are still
      supported.

  ■   To handle the 32-bit offset, the device driver code has to make use of
      the extended register set of the 80386. It may have to use ESI, EDI,
      EAX, EBX, ECX, EBP, FS, and GS. The existing code can be modified
      easily by using just the corresponding extended registers for the
      register used by drivers that work with 16-bit offsets.

  ■   Due to the additional fields in the header (which, however, are not
      currently being used), the driver may need to recompute the offset to
      the character offset table.



3.4  Device-Independent Bitmaps

Color bitmaps have always been susceptible to problems involving device
dependencies. To alleviate these problems, Windows 3.0 now supports
device-independent bitmap (DIB) formats and new entry points into the
display driver to handle these maps.

The following entry points have been introduced to handle DIBs:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Call                              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SetDIBits                         Copies the information from a DIB into a
                                  device-dependent bitmap format.

GetDIBits                         Does the inverse conversion, copying out
Call                              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GetDIBits                         Does the inverse conversion, copying out
                                  the bits from a device-dependent bitmap
                                  into a DIB format.

SetDIBitsToDevice                 Enables an application to block transfer
                                  (blt) any portion of a DIB directly onto
                                  the screen. However, in this case, a
                                  direct copy of the source is done with no
                                  other raster operations being supported.

StretchDIBits                     Moves a source rectangle into a
                                  destination rectangle, stretching or
                                  compressing the bitmap if necessary to fit
                                  the dimensions of the destination
                                  rectangle.



The driver also has to support a dummy function, CreateDIBitmap, that should
just return zero in AX indicating that the creation of a DIB is not
supported at the driver level.

The following sections discuss the structure of each of these functions and
their implementation at the device driver level. For a more detailed
discussion of the BITMAPINFO, BITMAPINFOHEADER, and RGBQUAD data structures,
see the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit.


3.4.1  SetDIBits and GetDIBits

The entry point in the driver for these two functions is the same. GDI
passes an extra flag to the driver indicating whether to execute the Set or
the Get call. In the following examples, the "entry point function" for
these two functions is called DeviceBitmapBits. This function does some
validations and, then, calls either the Set or the Get subfunctions to do
the actual task.

In a Get, lp_DI_bits being NULL indicates that the SizeImage field should be
filled and no bits returned. For an RLE, this will involve doing an "empty"
encoding run.

For a modular design, you should handle all the Run Length Encoded (RLE)
DIBs in a separate function. This entry point function checks to see whether
or not the DIB is in RLE format. If it is, then it calls RLEBitBlt, a
function local to the driver, to do the bit transfer. We will discuss the
structure of RLEBitBlt after describing the local functions that handle
unencoded DIBs.

Since the SetDIBits and GetDIBits functions are not used as often as the
other important functions such as BitBlt or ExtTextOut, you should group
them in a separate discardable code segment.

The structure of this function is as follows:

  createSeg _DIMAPS,DIMapSeg,public,CODE
  sBegin  DIMapSeg

  externNP SetDeviceBitmapBits ; if defined in a separate file
  externNP GetDeviceBitmapBits ; if defined in a separate file

  cProc DeviceBitmapBits, &lt;FAR,PUBLIC,WIN,PASCAL&gt;,&lt;si, di&gt;

  parmD lp_dst_device   ; a long pointer to a device-dependent bitmap
       ; device
  parmW set_or_get   ; 0 =&gt; set, 1 =&gt; get bits call
  parmW iStart    ; start scan number in the source map
  parmW num_scans   ; number of scans to copy
  parmD lp_DI_bits   ; long pointer to the actual bits in the DIB
  parmD lp_DIB_header   ; long pointer to the DIB header block
  parmD lp_DrawMode   ; long pointer to the GDI DRAWMODE structure,
       ; only used to decode an RLE
  parmD lp_ConversionInfo  ; long pointer to Conversion Translate Table

[ Any local variable definitions ]

  cBegin

;

;

[ Do validations on the input parameters and return with AX set to 0 if the
parameters are not valid. ]

;

;

[ Test to see if the DIB is in RLE format. For RLE DIBs, the biStyle field
of the DIB header block will have the bit named RLE_FORMAT_4 or RLE_FORMAT_8
set. For RLE DIBs, do the following:


  1.  Prepare a clipping rectangle. For SetDIBits, the extents of the
      clipping rectangle are the width and height of the DIB. However, for
      GetDIBits, the extents are the width and height of the surface from
      which the bits are to be obtained.

  2.  Calculate the X and Y extents of the block to be transferred. These
      are identical to the X and Y extents of the clipping rectangle.

      The destination rectangle top-left corner is treated as being at
      (0,0).

      The parameters to the call are as follows:

      RLEBitBlt (lp_dst_dev, /*bitmap descriptor */
       0,0,  /*distance to left corner*/
       xExt,yExt, /*extents of blt*/
       iStart,  /*start scan number*/
       num_scans, /*no. of scans to blt*/
       set_or_get, /*direction of blt*/
       lp_clip_rect, /*lptr to clip rect*/
       lp_DrawMode, /*lptr to the structure*/
       lp_DI_Bits, /*lptr to DIB buffer*/
       lp_DIB_header /*lptr to header*/ )

  3.  Return from DeviceBitmapBits with the status code (either the number
      of scanlines done, zero for error, or -1 for cannot be done) returned
      by RLEBitBlt in AX. ]


;

;

[ Prepare variables that might be needed by the Set or Get subfunctions. ]

;

;

[ If Set or Get is 0, call SetDeviceBitmapBits to copy the bits from the DIB
format into the device-specific format. If Set or Get is 1, call
GetDeviceBitmapBits to do the copy in the reverse direction. ]

;

;

[ Preserve in AX the status code returned by the Set or Get subfunctions. ]


(The return value in AX is actually the number of scanlines copied.)

  cEnd

  cProc CreateDIBitmap,&lt;PUBLIC, FAR&gt;

  ; the dummy procedure

  cBegin
    xor ax, ax
  cEnd

  sEnd DIMapseg
  end

Check the input parameters to make sure the following is true:


  ■   The long pointers are all valid (NULL pointers can be detected here
      and errors reported).

  ■   Set or Get should be either a 0 or a 1.

  ■   The bits-per-pixel in the DIB format must be 1, 4, 8, or 24 and the
      number of planes must be 1.

  ■   The width of the device-dependent bitmap should be the same as that of
      the DIB. If this is not the case, clip to the smaller of the two
      bitmaps.


Next, decide whether or not the DIB is run length encoded. If it is, prepare
parameters for RLEBitBlt and call it to complete the transfer.

For normal DIBs, once you know that the input parameters are valid, you are
ready to do the actual job by calling the Set or Get subfunctions as
appropriate. However, this is also a convenient time to compute any
variables that have to be derived from the input parameters and that are
used by both subfunctions. For example, the following information might be
computed at this point:


  ■   Flags specifying whether the device-dependent bitmap is in a color or
      monochrome format and whether or not it spans a 64K boundary. Notice
      that the DIB could be a color map with the device-dependent bitmap in
      a monochrome format. If that were the case, you would then have to do
      the appropriate color conversions.

  ■   Other variables that would be of use during the actual conversion can
      also be calculated at this stage. These would include, for example,
      the width of a source and destination scan in bytes, and the starting
      byte offsets in the source and the destination maps.




SetDeviceBitmapBits

This is a NEAR function that is called from the DeviceBitmapBits function.
It converts and copies the bits in the DIB format into the device-dependent
format. Because most of the initial calculations have already been done in
the calling function, the parameters to this function would be the derived
variables and the pointers to the source and destination bitmap arrays. Also
included here is the RGBQUAD data structure for the color table.

The structure of this function would be something similar to the following
example:

[ The function should be put in the _DIMAPS segment. ]

  anpfnPreProc label word ; preprocessor jump table

   dw eti_1  ; preprocessor for 1 bit/pixel DIB
   dw eti_4  ; preprocessor for 4 bits/pixel DIB
   dw eti_8  ; preprocessor for 8 bits/pixel DIB
   dw eti_24  ; preprocessor for 24 bits/pixel DIB

  ; 'eti_' can be read as 'external_to_internal_'

      ;   destination bitmap

   parmD   iStart  ; start scan number
   parmD   lp_DI_bits_start; long pointer to DIB bits start scan
   parmD   lp_DIB_header ; long pointer to DIB header
   parmD   fbsd  ; flag byte passed by DeviceBitmapBits

[ Other derived parameters such as width of scans, flags, etc. ]

[ Local and other temporary variables ]

  localW full_byte_proc  ; address of full-byte conv routine
  localW partial_byte_proc ; address of partial-byte conv
      ;   routine
  localV color_translate,256 ; color translation table

  cBegin

[ Depending on the number of bits/pixel, do format-specific initializations.
Decide which local routine to use to convert bits from the source that yield
one byte for the destination, and which routine to use for the partial bytes
at the end of the destination (if any). ]

[ Convert the source bitmap area one scan at a time. For every scan, use
"call full_byte_proc" with the number of complete destination bytes that are
to be generated and "call partial_byte_proc" with appropriate end-byte masks
for the partial bytes near the ends of the scans in the destination map (if
any). While updating the pointers to the next scan and copying the bytes in
a scan, take care of cases when the scans may cross the 64K boundaries. ]

[ Set AX to the number of scanlines done to indicate success. ]

[ A similar set of functions would be defined for the four DIB formats to do
the conversion into a monochrome device-dependent bitmap format. ]

By having a separate conversion routine for each DIB format and for each of
the two types of device-dependent bitmap formats (i.e., color and
monochrome), a lot of conditional checks can be avoided in the body of the
main conversion loop, which improves the throughput.

Each entry in the color table for non-palette devices, which is passed
through the BITMAPINFO header, consists of an RGB Quad. The following is the
RGBQUAD data structure:

  typedef struct {
   BYTE rgbBlue;
   BYTE rgbGreen;
   BYTE rgbRed;
   BYTE rgbReserved;
   } RGBQUAD;


Format-Specific Initializations

There are three reasons for having format-specific initializations:


  1.  To store the addresses of the appropriate full and partial byte
      procedures in the respective variables used in the "call" instructions
      in the body of the loop.

  2.  To calculate the number of complete source bytes that result from the
      conversion and the alignment of the partial bits in the last byte.

  3.  To prepare the color table holding the color in the device-specific
      format for each of the colors in the DIB format. (The color mapping
      for 24 bits/pixel should be done during the conversion to avoid having
      to store a huge table.)

      The biClrUsed field of the DIB header block is important here. If it
      is zero, the DIB uses the format-specific default color table size.
      That is, a 4 bits-per-pixel DIB will have 16 colors, an 8
      bits-per-pixel DIB will have 256 colors, etc. However, if biClrUsed is
      nonzero, it specifies the size of the table and cannot be more than
      the default size.


Another point to notice here is that some of the DIB formats may never yield
a partial byte. For example, since the source scans are always DWORD
aligned, the 1, 4, and 8 bits-per-pixel DIB formats will always yield an
integral number of destination bytes if the destination format is 1
bit-per-pixel (and may have multiple planes). In these cases, we can use the
full_byte_proc alone to convert the entire scan (including the filler bits
at the end, if there are any). However, we can still define partial-byte
conversion routines for these cases and use them for those scans that span a
64K boundary.

Doing the color mapping from the independent to the device-specific format
speeds up the conversion process substantially. If you did it the other way,
you could end up doing the mapping for the same source color as many times
as it appears in the picture. You could, of course, store the converted
colors on the stack. However, in the 24 bits-per-pixel case, the converted
table size would become huge (a maximum of 16 megabytes). Then, you would
have to do the color mapping at the same time as the transfer.


GetDeviceBitmapBits

This function has a structure exactly the same as its Set counterpart,
except for the color mapping and the fact that the direction of copy is now
reversed.

Here you actually need to do an inverse color mapping, from the
device-specific format to one of the DIB formats. You also have to create
the logical color table that resides in the DIB header block. The device
driver, if it is not a palette device, can fill up the logical color table
with whatever color it supports and, then, use the corresponding indices in
the bitmap. It must also set the number of colors it is using in the
biClrUsed field of the header block.

Consider an example in which the display device is a 4-plane EGA device (the
first plane is for red, the second for green, and the third for blue) and in
which the DIB has 8 bits-per-pixel. The logical color table for the DIB has
provisions for 256 colors, but the 4-plane driver can deal with only 16
colors. The driver would prepare a color table for the DIB that looked like
the following:

╓┌──────────┌────┌──────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Entry No.  Red  Green  Blue
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
0          0    0      0
1          128  0      0
2          0    128    0
3          128  128    0
4          0    0      128
5          128  0      128
6          0    128    128
Entry No.  Red  Green  Blue
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6          0    128    128
7          128  128    128
8(VGA)     196  196    196
8(EGA)     64   64     64
9          255  0      0
10         0    255    0
11         255  255    0
12         0    0      255
13         255  0      255
14         0    255    255
15         255  255    255


The device driver may fill in just 16 colors and set biClrUsed = 16, or it
may fill up entries 16 through 255 with zeros and set biClrUsed = 0.

While doing the conversion, a pixel for the destination DIB can be prepared
by storing a bit from each plane of a pixel in the lower significant 4 bits
out of the 8, with the other bits all being 0.

The color mapping tables for each of the DIB formats can be predefined for a
particular driver and should be copied into the DIB header during the
format-specific initialization.

[ Define other local variables. ]

  cBegin

[ Set up the flag bits in SurfaceFlags and a long pointer to point to the
start byte of the display surface. ]

[ The Y orientation of RLE DIB is the inverse of the Windows convention. You
start encoding from the bottom left of the display surface and work up. So,
set the current position at X = DstX and Y = DstY + DstYE - 1. ]

[ If a "get" from the surface into the RLE DIB is called for, go to
GetRLEBits. ]

[ If a "get length" (where lpRLEBits is equal to 0) is called for, do the
same as GetRLEBits, but only return the size of the necessary output buffer.
Put this length into the info block as well. The length needs to be filled
into the DIB header on every Get operation.]

  SetRLEBits:

[ Create a color translate table, converting the logical colors specified in
the RLE DIB header block into color indices in the device format. Notice
that, if the biClrUsed field is nonzero, it specifies the number of colors
contained in the color table.

Also, for monochrome display surfaces, set the "color index byte" to be 00H
or 0FFH depending on whether the color is to be treated as black or white. ]


[ If the display surface is EGA/VGA, do the following:


  1.  Exclude the cursor from within the clip rectangle.

  2.  For color devices, initialize the adapter registers to be in write
      mode 2. Enable all the planes for color devices and just plane 0 for
      monochrome displays. Leave the address of the bit-mask register in the
      graphics controller address register.

  3.  Set up the following memory variables to the corresponding function
      addresses:

[ For memory bitmaps, set up the address variables as follows:

set_partial_pixels                &lt;── mem_set_pixels_partial



set_full_pixels                   &lt;── mem_set_pixels_full

  4.  For huge bitmaps:

set_get_start_offset              &lt;── set_huge_start offset]




[ Load DS:SI and point to start of RLE buffer. Load ES with display surface
selector. ]

  set_decode_RLE:

[ Get the type of RLE record and select one of the following cases.]


[case: absolute mode:]


  ■   Get the number of pixels in the segment.

  ■   Save SI and the number of pixels in the segment.

  ■   Call set_get_segment (defined later, it figures out the position of
      the segment relative to the clip rectangle and returns the number of
      pixels within the clip rectangle in CX, the abscissa of the start of
      the segment in DI, and updates DS:SI in case of clipping to the first
      visible pixel's color byte.)

  ■   If CX=0, the segment is totally clipped.

  ■   If CX != 0, call set_multi_pixel_segment to decode and transfer the
      pixels.

  ■   Restore SI and update it by the number of pixels in the segment.

  ■   Jump back to set_decode_RLE.



[case: encoded run:]


  ■   Save SI and the number of pixels in the segment.

  ■   Call set_get_segment to get the count of pixels within the clip
      rectangle and the start abscissa in DI. Ignore the returned value of
      SI and have SI pointing to the color for the pixel in the segment.

  ■   If CX=0, the segment is totally clipped.

  ■   If CX != 0, call set_one_pixel_segment to decode and transfer the
      pixels.

  ■   Update SI by the number of pixels in the segment.

  ■   Jump back to set_decode_RLE.



[case: delta encoded record:]


  ■   Update X and Y by the delta_x and delta_y specified in the record.

  ■   Jump back to  set_decode_RLE.



[case: end-of-line:]


  ■   Set X = DstX and Y = Y - 1.

  ■   Jump back to set_decode_RLE.



[case: end-of-segment:]


  ■   Update DS:SI to the start of the next 64K segment.



[case: end-of-frame:]


  ■   You are done with the transfer. If the surface is a device, then do
      the reinitializations and unexclude the cursor.

  ■   Set AX=1 (success).

  ■   Jump to RLEend.


  GetRLEBits:

[ Fill up the color table with the colors that the device supports and set
biClrUsed. ]

[If the surface is a device, then exclude the cursor from within the clip
rectangle.]

[ Depending on whether the surface is color or monochrome, get the
appropriate routine from the FetchFromBuffer and FetchIntoBuffer tables and
put it into get_pixel_from_buffer and save_get_pixel_addr, respectively. ]

[ Set up ES:DI to point to the start of the RLE buffer and load DS with the
surface selector. ]

[ Based on the type of the surface, load in DS:SI the offset that
corresponds to the start point (X,Y).]

  get_rect_code_loop:

[ Save SI and set the number of buffered pixels fetched from the display
surface to be 0. ]

[ Load the address saved in save_get_pixel_addr into the fill_pixel_buffer
variable. ]

[ Call get_next_pixel to get the pixel at (X,Y). ]

[ Remember the pixel value as last_pixel and set the count of pixels to be
1. ]

[ Encode the pixels in one scan. This piece of code can be implemented based
on a state transition model.

The states are as follows:

╓┌───────────────────────────────────┌───────────────────────────────────────╖
State                               Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
initial_state                       You start here for every scanline and,
                                    at this point, remember the value of
                                    the last pixel.
State                               Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                    the last pixel.

initial_to_encode or                You come here when the next pixel
encode_to_encode                    matches the first pixel value that you
                                    remembered.

encode_absolute                     When the new pixel differs from the
                                    last pixel, you switch to the absolute
                                    encoding mode.

encode_overflow                     When the number of pixels in an
                                    encoded run reaches 255, you have to
                                    close the record. Remember the new
                                    pixel as the last pixel, set the count
                                    to 1, and go back to the initial state.

initial_to_absolute                 You get here when you start from an
                                    initial state with the first two
                                    pixels being different.
State                               Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                    pixels being different.

absolute_absolute                   You stay here as long as you keep
                                    getting different pixels.

absolute_overflow                   Similar to encode_overflow; you have
                                    to close this run as the number of
                                    pixels reaches 255.

encode_to_scan_end or               At each of the states, you count the
absolute_to_scan_end                number of pixels left in the scan.
                                    When this turns to 0, you get to one
                                    of these states, depending on whether
                                    you were in an encoded or an absolute
                                    run.]



[ After converting every scan, set the code for end-of-line. ]

[ Decide if the worst-case encoding of the next scan is going to fit in the
remainder of the current segment. If it does not, then add an end-of-segment
code and update ES:DI to the next segment. ]

[ Until there are no more scans to convert, loop back to get_rect_code_loop.
]

  ; you have reached the end of encoding.

[ Find out the size of the encoded image from the current and initial value
of ES:DI and save this in the biSizeImage field of the DIB header block. ]

[ If the display surface was a device, bring back the cursor. ]

[ Set AX = the number of scanlines done to indicate success. ]

  ; The strategy that you use for obtaining the next pixel is as follows:

  ;
  ; If the first byte has a mask, you throw off the unused portion of
  ; the byte and maintain a count of the pixels in the buffer.
  ;
  ; As long as you have pixels in the buffer, you get the pixels from
  ; there and this routine is device-format independent.
  ;
  ; When the buffer is empty, you get the next set of bits from the
  ; surface. For this, you have separate routines for screen and
  ; bitmap, and for color and monochrome.

  ; Since you have to define the following routines, the parameters to
  ; them would be the mask and current byte.

  ; For color devices:

  dev_color_get_pixels_masked ─ masked pixels from color screen
  dev_color_get_pixels  ─ complete byte fetch

  ; For monochrome displays:

  dev_mono_get_pixels_masked ─ masked byte fetch
  dev_mono_get_pixels  ─ complete byte fetch

  ; correspondingly, you have four routines for bitmap:
  ; two for color and two for monochrome:

  mem_color_get_pixels_masked
  mem_color_get_pixels
  mem_mono_get_pixels_masked
  mem_mono_get_pixels

  ; finally, the structure of the get_next_pixel routine is as follows:

  get_next_pixel proc near

[ If you still have pixels in the buffer, call a routine to fetch pixels
from the buffer. You may have one routine to fetch color pixels and another
to fetch monochrome pixels. ]

[ If the buffer is empty, call a device-format specific routine to fetch the

pixel in the buffer and update the count of pixels in the buffer. ]

  get_next_pixel endp

  ;──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────;

The reason for organizing the structure of the routine in the above format
is that there are two distinct parts. The main part is device independent
and controls the transfer process. This takes help from the second part
which is a collection of device-type specific routines.


3.4.2  SetDIBitsToDevice

This third entry point function in the set is for block transferring
(blt'ing) a portion of a DIB directly onto the screen. This call saves you
the trouble of first converting the DIB into the device-dependent format
and, then, transferring it onto the screen. However, only a direct copy of
the DIB is provided. Should you want to use the other raster operations that
BitBlt supports, you must first convert the DIB into the internal format.
Moreover, only one direction of copy (DIB to screen) is provided.

The process of copying out the bits is similar to the one adopted in the
SetDeviceBitmapBits function except that for some devices, such as the
EGA/VGA, the nature of the hardware might make it advantageous to copy one
pixel at a time. Here you would need a mask for the current pixel in a byte
and, in these cases, you could do away with the partial_byte conversion
routines and continue working with a mask that is rotated and aligned for
every pixel that you copy out.

The idea of having a color translate table and format-specific
initialization remains the same. The structure of this function is outlined
below. (Please notice the different calling parameters.)

[ The function should be defined in the_DIMAPS segment as was done for the
others. ]

  cProc SetDIBitsToDevice,&lt;FAR,PUBLIC,WIN,PASCAL,&lt;si, di&gt;

  parmD   lp_dest_device  ; long pointer to screen device descriptor
  parmW   ScreenXOrigin  ; top left corner x coordinate
  parmW   ScreenYOrigin  ; top left corner y coordinate
  parmW   StartScan  ; start scan number in the DIB buffer
  parmW   NumScans   ; number of scans to copy
  parmD   lp_clip_rect  ; long pointer to clip rect on screen
  parmD   lp_DrawMode  ; long pointer to GDI drawmode structure
  parmD   lp_DIB_bits  ; long pointer to the DIB buffer
  parmD   lp_DIB_header  ; long pointer to DIB header block
  parmD   lp_ConversionInfo ; long pointer to Conversion Translate Table

[ Notice that the DIB bit buffer may not start at the start scan number 0,
but could start at the number contained in StartScan. However, DIBYOrigin is
the actual Y origin relative to start scan 0. Also remember that the DIB bit
is actually inverted in the Y direction. ]

[ Define local and temporary variables here. ]

  cBegin

[ If the biStyle field of the DIB header has the RLE_FORMAT_4 or
RLE_FORMAT_8 bit set, then call RLEBitBlt to do the transfer. The set of
parameters for the calls is similar to what was used in the DeviceBitmapBits
function, except that the extents of the rectangles are the extents of the
DIB. The Set or Get code is zero to imply a set, and the top-left corner of
the destination is set to ScreenXOrigin and ScreenYOrigin. ]

[ Validate the input parameters and return with AX set to 0 if any of the
parameters are not valid. ]

[ Clip the blt rectangle in the DIB against the clipping rectangle on the
screen. Return with AX set to 0 (i.e., 0 scans copied) if the rectangle is
clipped totally and nothing shows. ]

[ Exclude the display of the cursor from the blt area on screen. ]

[ Calculate the required parameters such as length of scan, start bitmask,
number of pixels to blt on a scan, and number of scans to blt. ]

[ Start offset of the first bytes on the screen and in the DIB. Remember
that the source rectangle is going to be copied upside down onto the
rectangle on the screen. ]

[ Perform format-specific initializations depending on the number of
bits/pixel in the DIB. This includes storing the address of the routine that
converts the source pixels one pixel at a time, while adjusting the pixel
mask every time. ]

[ Transfer the source rectangle out one scan at a time, each time calling
the conversion routine whose address has been computed during
initialization. While the pointers are being updated to the next scan start
and the pixels are being copied, take care of scans that span a 64K segment
boundary. ]

[ Return with AX set to the number of scans copied. ]

  cEnd

  ; at this point, organize the format-specific initialization and
  ; conversion routines.

[ These routines are similar to the ones discussed for SetDeviceBitmapBits
except for the following differences.


  ■   Partial-byte procedures are not necessary, but segment crossing should
      be taken care of in the conversion routines for scans that do span a
      segment.

  ■   The conversion routine takes as input a start mask and the number of
      pixels to convert. It adjusts the mask after copying each
      color-translated pixel. This is repeated until the complete scan is
      covered.]


[ As in the case of the SetDeviceBitmapBits function, you need to have
separate functions depending upon whether the driver is a monochrome or
color device. You can make this function be specific only to a color or a
monochrome driver and save some code. ]


3.4.3  StretchDIBits

This function moves a source rectangle into a destination rectangle,
stretching or compressing the bitmap if necessary to fit the dimensions of
the destination rectangle. Either the source or the destination rectangle
will be in a device-independent bitmap; this is indicated by the GetOrSet
parameter (a zero value, meaning Set, has the DIB as the source, while a one
value, meaning Get, has the DIB as the destination).

For Windows 3.0, the source bitmap will always be a DIB (with GetOrSet = 0).
The destination bitmap can be either a memory bitmap or the actual device
surface.

As with the other output functions, returning -1 tells GDI to simulate the
operation. This is very useful if, for example, your driver can do integer
stretching, and the given stretch is non-integer.

The parameters to the StretchDIBits function (export ordinal 28) are as
follows:

  StretchDIBits(

  ParmD   lpPDevice ; PDevice;  bitmap or surface
  ParmW   GetOrSet  ; 0 -- set;  1--get (FUTURE)
     ; only really do 0 right now

  ParmW   DestX
  ParmW   DestY
  ParmW   DestXE
  ParmW   DestYE

  ParmW   SrcX
  ParmW   SrcY
  ParmW   SrcXE
  ParmW   SrcYE

  ParmD   lpBits
  ParmD   lpBitmapInfo
  ParmD   lpTranslate ; just like in current DIBits call
     ; (ignored by non-pal devices)

  ParmD   dwROP

  ParmD   lpBrush  ; current brush
  ParmD   lpDrawMode
  ParmD   lpClipRect
   )

If it cannot do it, it will return -1. Otherwise, it will return the number
of scans handled.

Current PostScript driver support is as follows:

  if lpDevice is surface AND
             GetOrSet == 0 AND
             dwROP = SRCCOPY
          {
             goforit
          }
          else
             return(-1)

This completes the discussion on the implementation of the four entry
points. The next section discusses the extra bit settings in the GDIINFO
block and how to declare these functions in the .DEF file.


3.4.4  Changes in the GDIINFO Block and .DEF File

You must use the GDIINFO block to inform GDI that the driver can now handle
DIBs. Do this at offset number 38 of the block (Miscellaneous Raster
Capabilities), using the equate RC_DI_BITMAP (defined as 0000000010000000b
in GDIDEFS.INC) for DIB-to-memory bitmap capabilities and the equate
RC_DIBTODEV (defined as 0000001000000000b in GDIDEFS.INC) for DIB-to-device
transfer capabilities. However, if you do not set the RC_DI_BITMAP wflag,
GDI will simulate in monochrome.

The three DIB entry point functions (at the driver level) should be exported
by defining entries in the export section of the .DEF file for the driver.
These entries should be made right after the ExtTextOut and attribute
functions, before the polyline drawing function, and in the following order:

╓┌──────────────────────────────────┌────────────────────────────────────────╖
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DeviceBitmapBits                   @19
CreateDIBitmap                     @20
SetDIBitsToDevice                  @21
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SetDIBitsToDevice                  @21


Moreover, the new code segment that holds the code for these functions
should also be defined as a discardable code segment. The definition in the
.DEF file should be as follows:

SEGMENTS _DIMAPS PRELOAD MOVEABLE DISCARDABLE SHARED _other segments     .


3.5  Checklist For Updating 2.x Display Drivers To 3.0

The following is a list of the major new Windows 3.0 features that will
affect drivers:


  ■   Color palette management

  ■   Protected-mode support

  ■   &gt; 64K fonts

  ■   Device-independent bitmaps


Sections briefly highlighting the changes that you will need to make to your
drivers were provided in this chapter. However, we strongly recommend that
you also review the corresponding sections in the Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit (SDK). They contain more information that might be useful to
you while reading this chapter and its checklist.

While rebuilding a Windows 2.x driver with 3.0 tools, you should use the
following checklist, which summarizes the points made in this chapter, to
keep track of each supported feature as added. When done, thoroughly retest
the driver to ensure compatibility.


  ■   Display devices capable of displaying at least 256 simultaneous colors
      out of a palette may require a color palette management interface. To
      support palette management, the device driver must provide the
      following:

      An interface to get (read) and to set (write) the hardware palette.

      An interface to get/set the driver-maintained color translate table.

      An UpdateColors function/entry point.

      An updated version number (0300H).

      A setting for the RC_PALETTE bit for the dpRaster entry in GDIINFO.

      Color translation in all draw mode, pen, and physical brush
      structures.

  ■   All Windows 3.0 drivers have to be bimodal, i.e., they have to run in
      protected mode as well as 8086 real address mode. To do so, you may
      need to use some of these functions from KERNEL:

      AllocSelector() ─ to get a selector

      FreeSelector(wSel) ─ to free a selector

      ChangeSelector(wSrcSel, wDestSel) ─ for code &lt;─&gt; data selector
      conversion

      AllocCSToDSAlias(wSel) ─ to get a data alias of the code selector

      AllocDSToCSAlias(wSel) ─ to get a code alias of the data selector

      __AHIncr ─ to do selector huge increments

      __GetWinFlags ─ to get information on the CPU and Windows modes

  ■   To avoid general protection faults, do not do any of the following:

      Access (read or write) an array beyond its limits.

      Have an offset wrap-around (going from 0FFFFH to 0 using a string
      instruction).

      Load an invalid selector into a segment register.

      Update code segment variables.

      Do segment arithmetic (except as described) for selector registers.

      Compare segment (selector) registers to see which is lower in memory.

      Use undocumented MS-DOS calls. You should use Windows calls whenever
      possible.

  ■   To support &gt; 64K fonts, make the following code changes:

      The driver must set the RC_BIGFONT bit of the raster capabilities
      (dpRaster) WORD in the GDIINFO data structure.

      When addressing character bitmaps, modify the existing code by using
      the corresponding extended (32-bit) register for the register used by
      drivers that work with 16-bit offsets.

      Due to the additional (but currently unused) fields in the header
      between dfDBFiller and dfCharOffset, the driver may need to recompute
      the offset to the character offset table or use an appropriately
      updated structure.

  ■   To handle device-independent bitmaps (DIBs), use the following new
      functions:

      SetDIBits (has the same entry point as GetDIBits)

      GetDIBits (has the same entry point as SetDIBits)

      SetDIBitsToDevice

      StretchDIBits

      CreateDIBitmap (a dummy function)

  ■   In the GDIINFO block, define as discardable the new code segment for
      these DIB functions.








Chapter 4  Display Driver Grabbers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The "grabber" is that portion of the non-Windows application support layer
that allows the video subsystem to be shared between Microsoft Windows and
non-Windows applications. The grabber implements the video
subsystem-specific logic necessary to save and restore video context when
switching applications.

Microsoft supplies a number of grabbers for common video subsystems with the
retail version of Windows. Specialized, or less commonly used, video
subsystems will require a grabber module customized for that particular
hardware if non-Windows applications are to be properly supported. The
source code for the Microsoft grabbers is included with this Microsoft
Windows Device Development Kit (DDK).

A number of changes have been made to the grabbers for the real and standard
mode versions of the Windows 3.0 release. Specifically, grabber functions no
longer used by Windows 3.0 have been removed. In general, grabbers
compatible with Windows 2.1 should work with Windows 3.0 as long as they
support the InitScreen entry point. However, the 3.0 grabbers will not work
with Windows 2.1. The grabber source code included with the DDK still
contains the unused functions. However, they are excluded via IFDEF
statements in the source.

Windows 3.0 can operate in either protected or real mode on an 80286 and
later processors. Except for Windows in 386 enhanced mode, the grabber is
always invoked in the processor's real mode, making it possible to use the
grabber with protected-mode and real-mode Windows. For information on the
grabbers used with the 386 enhanced mode version of Windows 3.0, see Chapter
18, "The VDD and Grabber DLL," in the Microsoft Windows Virtual Device
Adaptation Guide.

This chapter documents the interface between Windows running in standard and
real mode and the video-specific grabber module. Only the functions actually
used by Windows 3.0 are documented; descriptions of functions used by
previous Windows releases are not included.

Some portions of the grabber documentation, such as the data structure
descriptions, are specific to the implementation of the Microsoft-supplied
grabbers. This information is supplied under the assumption that these
grabbers will be the starting point for anyone who wants to create a new
grabber module.

Familiarity with the Microsoft-supplied grabber source code is assumed
throughout this chapter.


4.1  Naming Conventions

The grabber files supplied in the retail version of Windows 3.0 have been
renamed to reflect the version with which they are to be used. Instead of
VGA.GRB, we now have VGA.GR2 for real and standard mode Windows and VGA.GR3
for 386 enhanced mode Windows. In some cases, several drivers may share one
grabber (e.g., EGACOLOR.GR2 is used for both EGA.DRV and EGAHIBW.DRV).


4.2  Grabber Entry Points

The grabber module is loaded by Windows when the user runs a non-Windows
application. Windows then calls a number of grabber entry points to
determine parameters, such as the video save buffer size, and to initialize
the video subsystem for the application. Windows also makes other calls into
the grabber to perform functions such as saving the screen before doing an
application context switch and restoring the screen after the context
switch.


4.2.1  Standard Function Dispatch Table

Windows loads the grabbers as a binary image and, then, transfers control to
them by means of a jump table at offset 0 of the grabber code segment.

Windows computes the offset of the desired entry point using the knowledge
that a near jump is 3 bytes long. However, as Windows makes a FAR call to
the jump table, the grabber must do a FAR return even though the functions
are NEAR. Windows will always set DS equal to the grabber's CS before making
the call.

Windows checks for the existence of an optional jump opcode at offset 015H
and assumes that the InitScreen entry point is present. InitScreen is always
called when a non-Windows application starts up and, subsequently, after
every context switch to that application.

The following is an example of a function dispatch table:

  org 0

  StdFuncTable label word
   jmp InquireGrab ;Func 00001h
   jmp Obsolete  ;Func 00002h
   jmp Obsolete  ;Func 00003h
   jmp Obsolete  ;Func 00004h
   jmp InquireSave ;Func 00005h
   jmp SaveScreen ;Func 00006h
   jmp RestoreScreen ;Func 00007h
   jmp InitScreen ;Func 00008h

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

The format of this table must remain fixed and must reside at offset 0.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


4.2.2  Extended Function Dispatch Table

The Windows 2.03 release added a number of extended functions to the grabber
interface. Because of the nature of the standard function dispatch table as
shown in the preceding section, extensions to the grabber interface are made
by means of subfunction calls to an existing standard function entry point.
The standard function used for this purpose is the InquireGrab call.
InquireGrab must dispatch control to additional function handlers if, upon
entry, AX contains a function number in the indicated range.

The following is an example of the extended function dispatch table. Notice
that this table differs from the standard table because it contains offsets,
not jump instructions.

  ExtFuncTable label word
   dw Obsolete  ;Func 0FFF4h
   dw Obsolete  ;Func 0FFF5h
   dw Obsolete  ;Func 0FFF6h
   dw Obsolete  ;Func 0FFF7h
   dw GetBlock  ;Func 0FFF8h
   dw Obsolete  ;Func 0FFF9h
   dw GetVersion ;Func 0FFFAh
   dw DisableSave ;Func 0FFFBh
   dw EnableSave ;Func 0FFFCh
   dw SetSwapDrive ;Func 0FFFDh
   dw GetInfo  ;Func 0FFFEh
   dw Obsolete  ;Func 0FFFFh


4.3  Data Structures

The following are examples of the most commonly used Windows grabber data
structures. This is the way Microsoft does it. However, you may elect to
create your own data structures or modify the following ones.


4.3.1  Grabber Information Structure

The extended grabber call GRAB_GETINFO fills a structure provided by Windows
with the current video state information. All non-dimensionless quantities
are one-based.

  GrabInfo struc
   giDisplayId db ? ;Display ID Code
   giScrType db ? ;see below
   giSizeX  dw ? ;X raster size in .1mm units
   giSizeY  dw ? ;Y raster size in .1mm units
   giCharsX  db ? ;# X char cells (columns)
   giCharsY  db ? ;# Y char cells (rows)
   giMouseScaleX db ? ;X transform for MS-MOUSE
   giMouseScaleY db ? ;Y transform for MS-MOUSE
   giReserved db 38 dup (?)
  GrabInfo ends

The following are the bitmaped codes for the giScrType field in the GRABINFO
structure:

  ST_TEXT  = 00000000b ;screen is alphanumeric
  ST_GRPH  = 00000001b ;screen is graphics
  ST_LARGE  = 00000010b ;screen is hiresolution graphics
  ST_SPECGRAB = 00000100b ;reserved


4.3.2  Grabber Request Packet Structure

Upon entry, all the block functions expect ES:DI to point to a GRABREQUEST
structure that is formatted as follows. Since not all the fields are used by
some functions, field usage is detailed in the header for each function.

  GrabRequest struc
   grlpData  dd ? ;long ptr to I/O buffer
   grXorg  db ? ;x origin (unsigned)
   grYorg  db ? ;y origin (unsigned)
   grXext  db ? ;x extent (unsigned)
   grYext  db ? ;y extent (unsigned)
   grStyle  db ? ;style flags
   grChar  db ? ;char code for fill ops
   grAttr  db ? ;attribute for fill ops
  GrabRequest ends

The following are the codes for the fScreenOps field of the GRABREQUEST data
structure's grStyle field:

  SCR_OP_MASK = 00000111b

  F_BOTH  = 000h   ;fill w/ single char and attr
  F_CHAR  = 001h  ;fill w/ single char only
  F_ATTR  = 002h   ;fill w/ single attr only
  C_BOTH  = 003h  ;copy chars and attrs from lpData
  C_CHAR  = 004h  ;copy chars only from lpData
  C_ATTR  = 005h  ;copy attrs only from lpData
  C_CHAR_F_ATTR = 006h   ;copy chars from lpData,fill w/ attr
  C_ATTR_F_CHAR = 007h   ;copy attrs from lpData,fill w/ char

The following are the codes for the fFormat field of the GRABREQUEST data
structure's grStyle field:

  FORMAT_MASK = 10000000b  ;mask to extract fFormat
  FMT_NATIVE = 00000000b  ;use format native to mode
  FMT_OTHER = 10000000b ;use clipbrd or fScreenOps

The following are the error codes for block operations:

  ERR_UNSUPPORTED = 0FFh  ;block op not supported
  ERR_BOUNDARY = 0FEh  ;src or dest range error


4.3.3  Grab Buffer Structure

The following is the format of the GRABST data structure:

  GrabSt struc
   gbType  dw ? ;see below
   gbSize  dw ? ;length (not including 1st 4 bytes)
   gbWidth  dw ? ;width of bitmap in pixels
   gbHeight   dw ? ;height of bitmap in raster lines
   gbPlanes   dw ? ;# of color planes in the bitmap
   gbPixel   dw ? ;# of adj color bits on each plane
   gbWidth2  dw ? ;width of bitmap in 0.1 mm units
   gbHeigh2  dw ? ;height of bitmap in 0.1 mm units
   gbBits   dw ? ;the actual bits
  GrabSt ends

The following are the codes for the gbType field of GRABST:

  GT_TEXT  = 1
  GT_OLDBITMAP = 2
  GT_NEWBITMAP = 3
  GT_RESERVED4 = 4
  GT_RESERVED5 = 5


4.3.4  Information Context Structure

INFOCONTEXT is a global structure shared by all the grabbers and may be
considered the non-Windows application version of the GDIINFO structure for
Windows drivers. It provides information needed by functions at all levels
of the grabber source directory tree. While storage for this structure is
always allocated in the leafnode directory module for each grabber, it is
typically validated by the GetMode function. Notice that it is essentially a
superset of the GRABINFO structure returned by the GetInfo entry point.
GRABINFO has sufficient reserved space so that this information may be made
available to the Windows layer in the future as well as allow for more
fields being added if needed.

  InfoContext struc
   icDisplayId db ? ;Display ID code
   icScrType db ? ;Screen type code
   icSizeX  dw ? ;Horz raster size in .1mm units
   icSizeY  dw ? ;Vert raster size in .1mm units
   icCharsX  db ? ;Number of character columns
   icCharsY  db ? ;Number of character rows
   icMouseScaleX db ? ;Mouse to grabber coord xform in X
   icMouseScaleY db ? ;Mouse to grabber coord xform in Y
   icPixelsX dw ? ;Number of pixels in X
   icPixelsY dw ? ;Number of pixels in Y
   icWidthBytes dw ? ;Width in bytes of a row/scanline
   icBitsPixel db ? ;Number of adjacent bits/pixel
   icPlanes  db ? ;Number of planes per pixel
   icInterlaceS db ? ;Interlace shift factor
   icInterlaceM db ? ;Interlace mask factor
   iclpScr  dd ? ;Long pointer to screen
   icScrLen  dw ? ;Current screen page length
  InfoContext ends


4.3.5  Device Context Structure

The DEVICECONTEXT structure is a device-dependent structure internal to the
low-level grabber modules. Its layout, content, and/or length will vary from
grabber to grabber in other branches of the grabber source directory tree.

The following is the DEVICECONTEXT structure for CGAHERC grabbers:

  DeviceContext struc
   dcScrMode db ?  ;BIOS screen mode
   dcScrStart dw ?  ;regen start position
   dcCursorPosn dw ?  ;cursor position in CRTC format
   dcCursorMode dw ?  ;cursor start/stop scanlines
   dcModeCtl db ?  ;3x8 mode reg data
   dcExModeCtl db ?  ;3xx extended mode reg data
   dcColorSelect db ?  ;3D9 color select reg data
   dcCrtcParms dw ?  ;-&gt;CRTC parms for non-BIOS modes
   dcfSwitchGmt db ?  ;switch graphics/multiple text
  DeviceContext ends

The following is the DEVICECONTEXT structure for EGA grabbers:

  DeviceContext struc
   dcScrMode db ?     ;BIOS screen mode
   dcScrStart dw ?     ;regen start position
   dcCursorPosn dw ?     ;cursor position in CRTC format
   dcCursorMode dw ?    ;cursor start/stop scanlines
   dcAddrPatch db ?    ;3Dx / 3Bx patch byte
   dcfSwitchGmt db ?    ;Switch graphics/multiple text
   dcFileNum dw ?    ;-&gt;random number in swapfile
   dcFontBank db 4  dup (?)  ;ERI font info
   dcSwapPath db 64 dup (?)  ;full swap path
  DeviceContext ends

The following is the DEVICECONTEXT structure for VGA grabbers:

  DeviceContext struc
   dcScrMode db ?   ;BIOS screen mode
   dcScrStart dw ?   ;regen start position
   dcCursorPosn dw ?   ;cursor position in CRTC format
   dcCursorMode dw ?   ;cursor start/stop scanlines
   dcAddrPatch db ?   ;3Dx / 3Bx patch byte
   dcfSwitchGmt db ?   ;Switch graphics/multiple text
   dcFileNum dw ?   ;-&gt;random number in swapfile
   dcFontBank db 8  dup (?)  ;VGA has 8 font banks
   dcSwapPath db 64 dup (?)  ;full swap path
  DeviceContext ends


4.4  Coordinate System

All the grabber block functions operate using a left-hand coordinate system
that is based on character cells in a manner similar to that used by the
PC's BIOS. The origin of the display surface (0,0) is located in the
upper-left corner of the screen. Positive X direction is to the right and
positive Y direction is downward. The coordinate space consists of the set
of integers that range from 0 to (icCharsX - 1) in the X direction and from
0 to (icCharsY - 1) in the Y direction. The quantities icCharsX and icCharsY
are found in the grabber's INFOCONTEXT structure, which may be obtained at
any time by calling the extended grabber entry point GetInfo. Notice that
points in this space represent the upper-left corner of the character cells,
not their center.

As indicated by their names, the block functions operate on blocks of
character cells. A block is fully specified by its origin (relative to the
screen origin) and its X and Y extents in the GRABREQUEST structure. The
extents are unsigned one-based quantities. A block is defined to be the set
of character cells in the 2-D range ([grXorg, grXorg + grXext], [grYorg,
grYorg + grYext]). Notice that specifying an extent of 0 on either axis has
the same effect as specifying an extent equal to the maximum screen extent
on that axis. In other words, the entire screen may be easily specified by
setting:

grXorg = grYorg = grXext = grYext = 0

For graphics mode, the same cell-based convention applies so that Windows
need not discern differences between graphics and text screens. The size of
a character cell in graphics mode is defined as the same size cell that BIOS
would use to display text using INT 010H functions. Although the current
grabbers do not yet support the specification of arbitrary block regions in
graphics mode, it is still possible to request a full-screen GetBlock
operation by using the preceding procedure. An attempt to specify any other
block in graphics mode will return the ERR_UNSUPPORTED error code.

Although the ERR_BOUNDARY error code is provided in GRABBER.INC for blocks
that violate the screen boundaries, none of the block functions can check
currently for this condition. Thus, the operation proceeds with undefined
results.


4.5  Buffer Size Calculations

The low-level functions of all the grabbers define a number of equates used
to calculate the size of various data buffers needed to take screen
snapshots and context-switch the display subsystem. Since these calculations
vary widely among display adapters, the motivations for many of the
assumptions may not be clear. Therefore, the explanation provided in the
following subsections is an attempt to clarify this process.


4.5.1  MAX_GBTEXTSIZE and MAX_GBGRPHSIZE

These two equates define the maximum size of the GRABST header (defined in
GRABBER.INC) when used to hold text and graphics, respectively, during a
screen grab (snapshot). The size of the data portion is display dependent
and defined by MAX_VISTEXT and MAX_VISGRPH.


4.5.2  MAX_CDSIZE

This equate defines the minimum size of the context data buffers needed to
support a video context switch (SaveScreen/RestoreScreen). It does not
include the size of buffers required to save the actual screen data, which
is defined by MAX_TOTTEXT and MAX_TOTGRPH. The definition of this equate is
split across 3 lines to make it fit within 80 columns.

All grabbers include the size of the Device Context (DC) and Information
Context (IC) structures as well as the size of the video BIOS data area in
this equate. The OEM may additionally include the size of OEM-specific data
structures that must be saved. Also, a given display device may require
storage for such things as device-specific BIOS areas. For the EGA, this
includes the size of the EGA BIOS data area as well as the 4 bytes
comprising the EGA SavePtr.


4.5.3  MAX_VISTEXT and MAX_VISGRPH

For most supported display devices, the size of the visible portion of a
text or graphics page is less than the total size of the page. Therefore,
some video RAM is unused. Screen grabs are defined to copy only that portion
of the screen that is visible. Unfortunately, the size of the visible page
varies among display modes. Since InquireGrab can return only one size for
text pages and one size for graphics pages, we must set MAX_VISTEXT and
MAX_VISGRPH to the size of the largest visual page we want to capture.

Notice that the page size indicated for text is actually somewhat larger
than a visual page since the screen grab buffer format specifies that text
grabs must have carriagereturn/linefeed pairs at the end of each line except
the last, which must be terminated by a WORD of zeros.

The character generator on the EGA is programmable and, therefore, the size
of a visual page is unknown at the time of InquireGrab. One could simply
specify a giant buffer, but that would be wasteful most of the time. Thus,
we have chosen the EGA's 43-line mode as the largest text screen we will
attempt to handle. Anything larger will require that the user select the PIF
settings for graphics. However, the VGA grabber will allow 50-line screen
grabs.

For graphics grabs, the maximum size we support is 16K for the EGA, which is
enough for one page of 640x200x1 or 320x200x2 graphics. We do not support
the hires/multicolor modes due to their large memory requirements (grabs are
asynchronous and cannot be swapped to disk).


4.5.4  MAX_TOTTEXT and MAX_TOTGRPH

According to settings in the Program Information File (PIF), a context
switch must save either the entire current page of text or
"graphics/multiple text." (See the Microsoft Windows User's Guide for more
information on PIF files.) The former case is well defined and includes both
the visual and offscreen portions of the current text page. The latter,
however, is open to interpretation by the implementer. For example, any
graphics mode on the CGA adapter requires the entire frame buffer, allowing
for only one page of graphics. Therefore, saving the graphics page
completely saves all the possible text pages as well.

Some display adapters, such as EGA and Hercules, differ in this respect in
that they contain multiple graphics pages. Here, you could interpret the PIF
setting to mean "multiple graphics/multiple text" and allocate space for the
union of all text and graphics pages. You could also elect to save the user
some memory and allocate space for only the largest single graphics page
(interpreting it as "single graphics/multiple text").

Unfortunately, both interpretations usually require prohibitive amounts of
memory. On the EGA or VGA, the first method would require that you save all
256K. The second would require saving 128K, since the largest graphics page
is in mode 010H (640x350x4) and requires four planes of 32K (including
offscreen memory). Therefore, the situation must be examined for each
display adapter, and a compromise reached.

As a compromise on the EGACOLOR or VGACOLOR grabbers, you must interpret the
PIF setting as "single page of lores graphics/some of the text pages." This
method requires an allocation of only 16K, which is enough for one page of
lores graphics or four of the 80x25 text pages. Since it is increasingly
important to save hires graphics also, the EGA grabber is designed to save
one page of hires graphics using virtual memory by swapping the page to
disk. This method is much slower than saving to a memory buffer, but uses
less of the user's memory.

The only compromise required on the EGAMONO or VGAMONO grabbers is the
interpretation of the PIF setting as "single page of graphics/all text
pages." This means it is possible to lose a graphics page if the non-Windows
application is maintaining two pages of graphics. However, this is a rare
enough occurrence that we choose not to penalize the user with a 64K data
buffer requirement "just to be safe."

As a compromise on the HERCULES grabber, you must interpret the PIF setting
as "single page of graphics/no text pages." The logic here is based on the
assumption that when graphics is active, text is not and, therefore, does
not need to be saved. Furthermore, it would take 64K to save both graphics
pages, which is far too much memory to request. It is rare that the user
runs an application that maintains images on both graphics pages, so it is
not necessary to require a 64K buffer.

No compromise is required on the CGA adapter since we save all 16K of the
adapter's memory.


4.5.5  GrabTextSize and GrabGrphSize

The GrabTextSize variable holds the minumum buffer size needed to support a
text grab. The GrabGrphSize variable holds the minimum buffer size needed to
support a graphics grab. These variables are initialized to the sum of
MAX_GBTEXTSIZE and MAX_VISTEXT, and MAX_GBGRPHSIZE and MAX_VISGRPH,
respectively. They are maintained as variables instead of constants so that
the grabber initialization functions may modify their size at run time if
other features are detected that need consideration.


4.5.6  SaveTextSize and SaveGrphSize

The SaveTextSize variable holds the minimum buffer size needed to support a
text context switch, while the SaveGrphSize variable holds the minimum
buffer size needed to support a graphics context switch. These variables are
initialized to the sum of MAX_CDSIZE and MAX_TOTTEXT, and MAX_CDSIZE and
MAX_TOTGRPH, respectively. They are maintained as variables instead of
constants so that the grabber initialization functions may modify their size
at run time if other features are detected that need consideration.

If the EGA Register Interface (ERI) is present for the EGA, the size of the
ERI's context buffer is added to these variables during DevInit so that data
may be saved as well. This is important since, in many cases, some
applications (such as Microsoft Word) use the ERI to modify EGA registers,
in which case this context data will be more accurate than the DC and IC
structures alone.

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpData                            If lpData = NULL, GetBlock does not
                                  actually perform the transfer; it simply
                                  returns the number of bytes the operation
                                  would have required. Otherwise, lpData is
                                  assumed to point to the buffer that

                                  assumed to point to the buffer that
                                  receives the screen data.

Xorg                              Specifies the unsigned X coordinate of the
                                  origin of the transfer in alpha coordinate
                                  space.

Yorg                              Specifies the unsigned Y coordinate of the
                                  origin of the transfer in alpha coordinate
                                  space.

Xext                              Specifies the unsigned X extent of the

Yext                              Specifies the unsigned Y extent of the
                                  rectangular block to transfer as measured

                                  rectangular block to transfer as measured
                                  from the origin specified by Xorg and Yorg.
                                  If Yext is zero, the entire height of the
                                  current screen is assumed.

Style                             The only field of Style used for GetBlock
                                  operations is the fFormat field.

                                  If fFormat = FMT_NATIVE, the data is
                                  copied in the native screen format for the
                                  current screen mode. Thus, text screens
                                  result in character/attribute pairs being
                                  copied, while graphics screens result in a
                                  bitmap. Since the native format is screen
                                  dependent, we recommend that it be used
                                  for save/restore purposes only; no
                                  interpretation of the data should be
                                  attempted.

                                  If fFormat = FMT_OTHER, the data will be
                                  copied in a variant of the Windows
                                  Clipboard format defined by the grab

Attr                              Not used for GetBlock operations.




Exit

AX = number of bytes transferred


Error Exit

AX = error code CF = 1


Comments

In text mode, the display adapter may contain multiple character sets or
allow downloadable character sets. The data returned in Clipboard format
will be translated to the "standard" OEM set if it can be determined that
another set is in use, which character set it is, and whether or not a
translation table is available for the job. The EGA is an example of an
adapter that makes it hard to determine that a set has been downloaded and
practically impossible to determine which one it is.


GetInfo
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Purpose

Returns the GRABINFO structure.

GetInfo fills a buffer pointed to by ES:DI on entry with data in the
GRABINFO format. Notice that the INFOCONTEXT structure is copied since it is
a superset of the GRABINFO structure (although INFOCONTEXT is not as big as
GRABINFO because of the existence of reserved fields in the latter).

Although Windows knows nothing about the reserved fields, you end up filling
some of them with the extra data in INFOCONTEXT because it is convenient for
debugging purposes. Because these fields are still reserved, they may change
at any time.

Notice that the block functions also check the current mode and return
ERR_UNSUPPORTED to indicate non-support for the request, which is the
preferred way to determine support for a given mode.


Entry

ES:DI -&gt; GRABINFO structure to fill


Exit

AX = 0 if block ops not supported on current mode (graphics) AX = 1 if block
ops supported on current mode (text)


GetVersion
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Purpose

Returns the grabber version number.


Entry

None


Exit

AX = version number


InitScreen
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Purpose

Initializes the screen to a known text mode and a requested number of
lines-per-screen.

This function is called by Windows once before the non-Windows application
starts up. Windows also calls this function after the non-Windows
application's screen has been saved and the DisableSave function has been
called during a context switch away from the application. The function is
called a third time after the non-Windows application finishes execution.
The last two calls to this function ensure that the display is left in a
known text mode before putting up Windows' preview switcher screen or going
back to Windows.


Entry

DS = CS

AX = Number of lines-per-screen (If the number of lines requested cannot be
supported by the display device, it will be rounded down to a figure that
the device can support. Notice that this parameter is new for Windows 3.0.
Earlier grabber versions do not take any parameter.)


Exit

None


InquireGrab
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Purpose

Returns the size of the grab buffer needed or dispatches an extended
function call.

In Microsoft Windows 1.0x, this routine handled only grab buffer size
requests.

Microsoft Windows 2.0x added the extended functions dispatched by
InquireGrab. For an explanation of the new subfunctions mentioned in Section
4.2.1, "Standard Function Dispatch Table," and Section 4.2.2, "Extended
Function Dispatch Table," refer to their descriptions in this section.


Entry

DS = CS AX = n

where n is either:

    1        Inquire text grab buffer size 2        Inquire graphics grab
    buffer size n &gt; 2  Extended subfunction request


Exit

If the function number is 1 or 2, DX:AX = size in bytes for the grab buffer


else exit status depends on the extended call.


Comments

To get any useful work from the grabber, Windows must call either
InquireGrab or InquireSave before any other call (InitScreen is a possible
exception). This is an opportunity to initialize the module if it is the
first time one of these entry points has been called.

The grabbers supplied by Microsoft also perform first-time internal
initialization when either InquireGrab or InquireSave are called for the
first time.

See also: InquireSave, GRABBER.INC, ENTRY.ASM


InquireSave
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Purpose

Returns the necessary size of the screen save buffer.


Entry

DS = CS AX = n

where n is either:

    1 Inquire text context save buffer size 2 Inquire graphics context save
    buffer size


Exit

DX:AX = size in bytes for save buffer


RestoreScreen
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Purpose

Restores a previously saved display context.


Entry

AX = size in bytes of screen save area DS = CS ES:DI -&gt; save area


Exit

CF = 0 (screen was successfully restored)


Error Exit

CF = 1 (unable to restore screen)


Comments

Windows guarantees that the offset portion of the screen save area will
always be zero.


SaveScreen
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Purpose

Saves the current display context.


Entry

AX = size in bytes of screen save area DS = CS ES:DI -&gt; screen save area


Exit

CF = 0 (screen was successfully saved)


Error Exit

CF = 1 (unable to save screen)


Comments

Windows guarantees that the offset portion of the screen save area will
always be zero.


SetSwapDrive
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Purpose

Sets the current swap drive and path.

The next SaveScreen call following this call uses the given swap drive
letter to open the swapfile, if needed. Failure to call this function at
least once before SaveScreen may result in a failure to context switch. This
drive and path information is stored as a static value and need not be set
before every call to SaveScreen. If it is known that the swap drive will
remain constant for the "life" of the grabber instance, then we recommend
that this call be done once, after Windows' decision to allow context
switching has been made.


Entry

BL = ASCII drive letter for swap (A, or B, or C, ...)  = 0FFH if no swap
drive available ES:DI -&gt; d:pathname template for Windows temporary file

Chapter 5  Printer Drivers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Microsoft Windows 3.0 printer drivers provide the interface necessary to
obtain device independence between the Windows environment and the printer
hardware. The driver gives Windows and Windows applications information on
support for fonts, paper trays and sizes, printer orientation, graphics
capabilities, color, and other advanced features that may be available on
the printer. This information may be used by applications in creating the
desired printed output.

Since printed output can come in a variety of different mediums by different
types of devices, you must have a unique driver to support your hardware's
technology. Such types of technology could be categorized as raster devices
(e.g., dot matrix, most laser, and inkjet printers and some film recorders),
vector devices (e.g., plotters), or devices with higher-level languages,
such as PostScript.

The printer driver interacts with the graphics device interface (GDI), Print
Manager, and, indirectly, with Windows applications via the GDI Escape()
function. The Escape() function supports many subfunctions; some are
required by the driver, and others are specifically defined to take full
advantage of unique technologies. In some cases, these additional escapes
provide Windows applications with support not available through GDI, such as
a mechanism to take advantage directly of higher-level devices. See Chapter
11, "Device Driver Escapes," for more information on and detailed
descriptions of these escapes.

This chapter describes the support you need to provide in your printer
driver. Of course, the extent of the support you provide depends on the type
of hardware supported. However, we strongly encourage you to implement all
the structures and functions defined in this chapter that are applicable to
your device. When you do so, Windows applications will be able to take full
advantage of your hardware device.

Information on the following topics is included here to help you provide
that support:


  ■   The GDI interface and driver/developer responsibilities

  ■   The functions and data structures involved in printer-driver
      initialization

  ■   The functions and data structures that form the printer-driver
      environment

  ■   The Print Manager support functions

  ■   The Control() function and the main printer escapes

  ■   Raster and vector devices and the use of banding drivers

  ■   The GDI graphics objects and their related functions

  ■   The GDI output functions

  ■   The printer driver stub functions

  ■   The requirements for updating Windows 2.x printer drivers to work
      under Windows 3.0

  ■   A checklist summarizing the main requirements for printer drivers




5.1  Basic Information

A Windows printer driver is a Windows dynamic-link library (DLL) that
implements a set of standard graphics primitives for a particular printer
device. Unlike most device drivers, a printer driver is generally not
responsible for hardware communication with the printer, a task normally
reserved for the Windows Print Manager and the communications driver. The
printer driver essentially translates the device-independent GDI interface
into a stream of printer commands and data.


5.1.1  The GDI Interface

GDI's interface to a printer driver is much simpler than an application's
interface to GDI, since GDI takes care of all the coordinate
transformations, object management, and most clipping. There is, however, an
analogy between the two sets of functions.

Applications that call GDI functions draw into GDI device contexts. A device
context (DC) is GDI's device-independent virtualization of the output
device, be it the display, a printer, a memory bitmap, or even a metafile
not associated with any specific device.

When GDI creates a device context, the printer driver is asked to supply
information about the printer, for example, the resolution of the device and
the number of colors. In addition, the printer driver is asked to create its
own internal state information about the device. The device-dependent state
(referred to as the physical device structure or PDEVICE) corresponds to the
DC at the driver level.

The application can request information about the device context, for
example, to determine what fonts are available. GDI will call the driver to
supply device-specific information. GDI will supply the driver with the
PDEVICE structure that corresponds to the DC the application is using.

Another portion of GDI deals with managing drawing tools or objects, such as
pens, brushes, and fonts. For the most part, GDI manages these objects
itself. However, when the application uses one of the objects to create
output, GDI asks the driver to create a device-specific representation of
the object.

When an application performs output to a particular DC by using the graphics
functions, GDI will first perform any necessary transformations and, then,
call the driver to perform that output into the corresponding physical
device. For simpler printer drivers, GDI may also simulate complex graphics,
such as filled polygons, with simpler driver primitives.


5.1.2  Additional Printer Driver Responsibilities

Printer drivers are responsible for providing a means for applications and
the system Control Panel to set up and manage the printer. Each printer
driver contains a dialog box for selecting printer options, such as paper
size and orientation. In Windows 3.0 printer drivers, this setup may also be
directly manipulated by applications without going through the DeviceMode()
dialog box.

In most cases, printer drivers are not responsible for sending bytes
directly to the output port. Instead, printer drivers call special GDI
functions to perform output. Depending on the options selected by the user,
those functions will route the output to a specific port, to a disk file,
across a network connection, or to a temporary file for later output by
Print Manager.


5.1.3  Printer-Driver Developer Responsibilities

Since printer drivers are Windows DLLs, the prospective printer-driver
developer should understand Windows programming, particularly in the areas
of libraries, which are different from applications, and memory management,
which is essential for ensuring good performance and cooperation within
Windows. An understanding of application programming is less important but
useful for writing the driver's Setup dialog box and for understanding the
printer driver's role in providing Windows device-independent graphics.

Source code for several printer drivers has been supplied on the disks
provided in this kit. These sources can provide a good basis for developing
drivers for similar printers. The samples cover a wide range of devices,
including the following:


  ■   A sample driver for an older version Epson (R) printer

  ■   A color driver for IBM's PC Color Printer

  ■   Drivers for two different laser printer command languages, PCL (for
      the HP LaserJet) and PostScript.


The next few sections provide descriptions of the services the driver must
provide and the Windows functions intended for driver use.


5.2  Printer Driver Initialization

When Windows creates a device context (DC) for a device, GDI makes two calls
to an entry point in the device's driver called Enable().

The first call to Enable() is used to create a data structure for GDI called
GDIINFO. The purpose of the GDIINFO structure is to describe the device to
GDI. The structure of GDIINFO is the same for all device drivers. (See
Section 5.2.2, "The GDIINFO Data Structure," in this chapter for a complete
description. See also Chapter 2, "Display Drivers," for another description
of GDIINFO from a display driver's perspective.)

The second call to Enable() causes the driver to initialize a second data
structure called PDEVICE. PDEVICE is entirely device dependent and is
generally used by the device driver to store state information for a
printing job.


5.2.1  The Enable() Function and Its Parameters

The Enable() function is declared as follows:

  WORD FAR PASCAL Enable(
   LPSTR  lpDest,
   WORD  style,
   LPSTR  lpDevice,
   LPSTR   lpOutput,
   LPDEVMODE lpInitData);

The lpDest parameter may contain a far pointer to either a GDIINFO or a
PDEVICE structure, depending on the contents of the style parameter. If the
low-order bit of style contains 0, the device driver initializes the GDIINFO
structure. Otherwise, lpDest points to the PDEVICE structure the driver must
initialize.

In either case, if the high-order bit is set, GDI creates an information
context (i.e., a device context used only for querying the device for
information and not for output). Some drivers can reduce the amount of
memory they allocate by assuming no output.

The lpDevice parameter points to a NULL-terminated string that identifies
the device (e.g., PCL / HP Laserjet). For printer devices, the name of the
device is the string installed in the [devices] section of the WIN.INI file.


The lpOutput parameter points to a NULL-terminated filename or MS-DOS device
name that identifies, for printer devices, the output port to which Print
Manager sends the printer data.

Printers often have a number of Setup options that a device driver can
represent in a device-dependent initialization data format. This data may
appear in a buffer pointed to by lpInitData. The role this data plays in
controlling the driver will be discussed in Section 5.3, "The Printer Driver
Environment."

Enable() returns the size of the structure copied if successful or zero if
an error occurred.


5.2.2  The GDIINFO Data Structure

The structure of GDIINFO is as follows:

  typedef struct _gdiinfo {
   int   dpVersion;
   int  dpTechnology;
   int  dpHorzSize
   int  dpVertSize;
   int   dpHorzRes;
   int   dpVertRes;
   int   dpBitsPixel;
   int   dpPlanes;
   int   dpNumBrushes;
   int   dpNumPens;
   int   futureuse;
   int   dpNumFonts;
   int   dpNumColors;
   unsigned dpDEVICEsize;
   unsigned dpCurves;
   unsigned dpLines;
   unsigned dpPolygonals;
   unsigned dpText;
   unsigned dpClip;
   unsigned dpRaster;
   int   dpAspectX;
   int   dpAspectY;
   int   dpAspectXY;
   int   dpStyleLen;
   POINT   dpMLoWin;
   POINT   dpMLoVpt;
   POINT   dpMHiWin;
   POINT   dpMHiVpt;
   POINT   dpELoWin;
   POINT   dpELoVpt;
   POINT   dpEHiWin;
   POINT   dpEHiVpt;
   POINT   dpTwpWin;
   POINT  dpTwpVpt;
   int   dpLogPixelsX;
   int   dpLogPixelsY;
   int   dpDCManage;
   int   futureuse3;
   int   futureuse4;
   int   futureuse5;
   int   futureuse6;
   int   futureuse7;
   int   dpPalColors;
   int   dpPalReserved;
   int   dpPalResolution;
  } GDIINFO;

This rather large structure really has three kinds of fields in it:


  ■   Driver management fields

  ■   Driver capabilities fields

  ■   Device dimension fields




The Driver Management Fields

These fields include the following:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
dpVersion                         Contains the version of Windows for which
                                  the driver was written (not the driver
                                  version number). This field should contain
                                  0x300 for drivers written for Windows 3.0
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  0x300 for drivers written for Windows 3.0
                                  and built with the 3.0 SDK tools.

dpTechnology                      Contains an index that broadly classifies
                                  the device. Possible classifications are
                                  either: Vector Plotter (0),Raster Display
                                  (1), Raster Printer (2), Raster Camera (3),
                                  Character Stream (4), Metafile or VDM (5),
                                  or Display File (6).

dpDEVICEsize                      Provides Size of (PDEVICE) or the number
                                  of bytes that GDI should allocate for the
                                  device's PDEVICE structure, which is
                                  initialized by the driver during the
                                  second Enable() call.

dpDCManage                        Specifies how multiple device contexts for
                                  the same device are to be treated.

Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────



The dpDCManage field contains a combination of three bits.

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Bit                               Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DC_SPDevice (1)                   Uses separate GDIINFO and PDEVICE
                                  structures for each DC created for the
                                  driver.

DC_1PDevice (2)                   For each combination of device name and
                                  output port name, only one DC is allowed
                                  to exist (i.e., only one PDEVICE is
                                  allocated).

DC_IgnoreDFNP (4)                 Uses the same PDEVICE and GDIINFO
                                  structures for all the DCs.
Bit                               Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  structures for all the DCs.



If none of these bits is set, there will be one GDIINFO and PDEVICE
structure allocated per output file, regardless of the number of device
contexts created on the port.

When DC_1PDevice and DC_IgnoreDFNP are combined, only one DC is allowed to
exist for a device, regardless of the output filename. Other combinations of
bits are invalid.

Printer drivers normally set the DC_SPDevice bit, allowing multiple
independent jobs to be spooled to the same printer simultaneously.


The Driver Capabilities Fields

The driver capabilities are specified by the following fields:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
dpNumBrushes                      The number of predefined brushes supported
                                  by the device.

dpNumPens                         The number of device pens.

dpNumColors                       The actual number of physical,
                                  non-dithered colors that the device can
                                  print.

dpCurves                          A bit field describing the driver's
                                  ability to output curved graphics (such as
                                  ellipses, arcs, or wedges) and what kind
                                  of
                                  effects can be supported.

dpLines                           A bit field describing the driver's
                                  ability to draw lines and polylines, and
                                  the effects that may be achieved with such
                                  figures.

dpPolygonals                      The capability of the device to support

dpText                            A bit field describing the level of
                                  support in the driver for text output,
                                  such as support for Windows fonts,
                                  transformations and effects, and scaling
                                  and output precision.

dpClip                            A bit field describing whether or not the
                                  device can do clipping. If this field is 0,
                                  the device cannot clip output. If it
                                  contains 1, the device can clip to an

dpRaster                          Additional capabilities for raster and
                                  display devices, such as
                                  bitmap and banding support.



Brushes, pens, fonts, and colors are discussed in more detail in Section
5.6, "GDI Graphics Objects."

The bit fields for curves through rasters are discussed in more detail in
Section 12.1, "Information Data Structures."

There are several new bits for the dpRaster field that have been defined for
version 3.0 drivers. They are as follows:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Bit                               Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RC_DI_BITMAP                      The device supports the conversion of
                                  device-independent
                                  bitmaps to compatible-memory bitmaps in
                                  all the DIB resolutions (1, 4, 8, and 24
                                  bits-per-pixel). However, if the flag is
                                  not set, GDI will simulate in monochrome.

RC_PALETTE                        The device uses a color palette. This bit
                                  is primarily for
                                  display devices.

RC_DIBTODEV                       The device can copy a device-independent
                                  bitmap to the page via SetDIBitsToDevice().

RC_BIGFONTS                       The device driver supports Windows font
                                  files in the new, version 3.0 format,
                                  which supports greater than (&gt;) 64K fonts.
                                  However, if the flag is not set, all the
                                  fonts will be in the old, version 2.0

RC_STRETCHBLT                     The device supports StretchBlt().

RC_FLOODFILL                      The device supports FloodFill().

RC_STRETCHDIB                     The device supports StretchDIBits().



For more information on these new, version 3.0 output functions, see Section
5.7, "Performing Output."

There are three additional fields that are used only if the driver is marked
as version 0x300 or higher. Generally, these entries are used only for
display drivers that use a color palette. The fields are as follows:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
dpPalColors                       The number of palette colors

dpPalReserved                     The number of reserved palette registers

dpPalResolution                   The color resolution or the number of bits
                                  in the palette registers



These fields will be ignored if the RC_PALETTE bit is not set in the
dpRaster field. However, they must be present (and accounted for in the
length returned by Enable()) if the driver is version 3.0.


The Device Dimension Fields

The last category of GDIINFO entries provides the dimension information.
Notice that the maximum width and length of text that can be printed on a
page is determined by choosing either the Portrait or Landscape mode. In
Portrait mode, the page is taller than wide, when viewing the text upright.
In Landscape mode, the page is wider than tall, when viewing the text
upright.

The GDIINFO device dimension fields are as follows:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
dpHorzSize                        The width of the printable area in
                                  millimeters.

dpVertSize                        The height or length of the printable area
                                  in millimeters.

dpHorzRes                         The width of the printable area in device
                                  units (pixels).

dpVertRes                         The height or length of the printable area
                                  in device units (raster lines or pixels).

Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

dpBitsPixel                       The number of bits required to represent
                                  the state of a single pixel in a single
                                  graphics plane.

dpPlanes                          The number of graphics planes.

                                  These last two fields are used mostly by
                                  bitmapped display drivers. Generally, one
                                  value is 1 and the other is the number of
                                  bits-per-pixel, depending on the layout of
                                  the display memory. Most printers do not
                                  support color, so 1 can be used in both
                                  fields. Banding color drivers should use
                                  the same values they
                                  use for their band bitmaps.

                                  NOTE   Devices choose numbers that match
                                  how they output color. Color printers that
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  how they output color. Color printers that
                                  use the color dot-matrix libraries specify
                                  the same values as the bitmap format. The
                                  color library in this kit uses one
                                  bit-per-pixel in three planes. The driver
                                  developer must modify the library to use
                                  another format.

dpAspectX                         The horizontal component of the aspect
                                  ratio.

dpAspectY                         The vertical component of the aspect ratio.

dpAspectXY                        The diagonal component of the aspect ratio
                                  (along the hypotenuse of a right triangle
                                  of sides dpAspectX and dpAspectY).

                                  These last three values represent the
                                  device aspect ratio. Since they are used
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  device aspect ratio. Since they are used
                                  relative to one another, they may be
                                  scaled as needed to get accurate integer
                                  values. They should be kept under 1000 for
                                  numerical stability in GDI calculations.
                                  In general, dpAspectXY2 = dpAspectX2 +
                                  dpAspectY2.

                                  For example, a device with a 1:1 aspect
                                  ratio (such as a 300 dpi laser printer)
                                  can use 100 for dpAspectX and dpAspectY
                                  and 141 (100 * 1.41421...) for dpAspectXY.

dpStyleLen                        This value specifies the minimum length of
                                  a dot in a styled line relative to the
                                  dpAspectXY value. It is usually 2 *
                                  dpAspectXY.

dpLogPixelsX                      The logical pixels-per-inch along the

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
dpLogPixelsX                      The logical pixels-per-inch along the
                                  horizontal axis.

dpLogPixelsY                      The logical pixels-per-inch along the
                                  vertical axis of the page.

                                  The adjective "logical" is for displays.
                                  For readability reasons, they use a
                                  logical inch, which is larger than a real
                                  ruler inch. Printer drivers should always
                                  use real inches. A 300 dpi laser printer
                                  puts 300 in both fields.




The POINT Dimension Fields and Mapping Modes

The remaining dimension fields of the GDIINFO structure (i.e., those with
type POINT) are used for scaling coordinates when certain mapping modes are
in use. For each mapping mode, there is a viewport point and a window point.


Place the device resolution in pixels-per-inch in the viewport fields and
the number of logical units-per-inch in the window fields. The y-coordinate
of the viewport is negated to reflect the fact that the x-axis (y = 0) is
along the top of the paper in the default mapping mode (MM_TEXT, which
specifies device coordinates) with y increasing while going down the page;
whereas in the other mapping modes, the x-axis (y = 0) is along the bottom
edge of the page.

There are five mapping modes with which to be concerned:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Mode                              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

                                  the dpELoWin and dpELoVpt fields.

MM_HIENGLISH                      1000 points per inch. Specified in the
Mode                              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

                                  dpEHiVpt fields.

MM_LOMETRIC                       10 points per millimeter or 254 points per
                                  inch. Specified in the dpMLoWin and
                                  dpMLoVpt fields.

MM_HIMETRIC                       100 points per millimeter or 2540 points
                                  per inch. Specified in the dpMHiWin and
                                  dpMHiVpt fields.

MM_TWIPS                          1440 points per inch. Specified in the
                                  dpTwpWin and dpTwpVpt fields. (A twip is a
                                  twentieth of a point, which is 1/72nd of
                                  an inch.)



For example, on a 300 dpi laser printer, the MM_TWIPS mapping mode will
require that dpTwpWin be set to (1440,1440) and dpTwpVpt be set to (300,
-300).

After Enable() returns GDIINFO to GDI, GDI will use the dpDEVICEsize field
to allocate a PDEVICE structure and, then, call Enable() again to initialize
it.

The structure of PDEVICE is entirely up to the device driver writer. This
structure will be passed to the driver on all output or information function
calls and is the driver's view of the device context. You should store in
the PDEVICE structure any information about the print job that the driver
needs to keep.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

Static storage in the driver's automatic data segment is undesirable for the
following reasons: there may be multiple, independent DCs in existence
simultaneously, and it increases the size and minimum memory requirements of
the driver even when no DC is in existence.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The only constraint on the PDEVICE structure is that the first WORD contain
a non-zero value. A device driver may be called to perform an output
operation to a bitmap rather than to the device itself. In this case, a
BITMAP structure replaces the PDEVICE structure, with the first WORD = 0.
This mechanism is discussed in more detail in Section 5.7, "Performing
Output."

Once GDI has successfully loaded the driver and allocated and initialized
both the GDIINFO and PDEVICE structures, GDI will return a device context
handle to the application. The application may query the DC for metric
information or create a print job, by using a mechanism described in Section
5.5, "The Control() Function."

When the application is finished with the device context that was created by
CreateDC(), it will call DeleteDC() to destroy the device context. GDI will
inform the device driver by calling the Disable() function, declared as
follows:

  void FAR PASCAL Disable(LPPDEVICE lpPDevice);

After this call, the PDEVICE structure will be deallocated. If there are no
other DCs in existence using this device driver, the driver DLL
(dynamic-link library) will be unloaded from the system.


5.3  The Printer Driver Environment

Printers normally have a large number of options from which the user can
select such things as paper size, paper source, or installed font
cartridges.

This information can come from any of four sources:


  1.  The driver's default setup.

  2.  The driver's WIN.INI section of user options. The WIN.INI should
      maintain at least one such section so that modified printer setups can
      be retained from session to session. This information is edited by the
      driver's Setup dialog box.

  3.  The driver may call GDI to retain the driver's environment from DC to
      DC on a port-by-port basis. This allows faster initialization of the
      driver and avoids the time-consuming process of reading options from
      the WIN.INI file.

  4.  The application can pass the environment to the driver in a buffer
      pointed to by the lpInitData parameter of the Enable() function.


Upon device initialization (i.e., during the pair of Enable() calls), this
information is used to set up information in the GDIINFO and PDEVICE
structures. For example, the paper size selection will affect the height and
width fields. Also, a printer that allows multiple graphics densities will
modify the various resolution fields.


5.3.1  The DEVMODE Data Structure

The DEVMODE data structure is used for the environment and the
initialization data (which are the same). By convention, all drivers place
the device name in the first 32 bytes of DEVMODE as a NULL-terminated
string. All the other data is device dependent.

For Windows 3.0, a new convention has been adopted that defines an
additional number of fields. These fields enable the application to perform
device-independent manipulations of the device environment.

When Enable() is called, the device driver should first check lpInitData to
see if the application has supplied valid initialization data. If it is
valid, then the driver should use that environment to initialize the GDIINFO
and PDEVICE structures and not use or modify the default environment
information.


5.3.2  The GetEnvironment() Function

If no initialization information is supplied, the driver should check the
printer environment maintained by GDI using the GetEnvironment() function,
which is declared as follows:

  WORD FAR PASCAL GetEnvironment (
   LPSTR   lpPort,
   LPDEVMODE lpDevMode,
   WORD   cbDevMode);

GetEnvironment() will copy into the DEVMODE buffer (pointed to by lpDevMode)
the first cbDevMode bytes of the environment for the port whose name is
specified by the NULL-terminated string pointed to by lpPort. The return
value is the number of bytes  actually copied (which may be less than
anticipated), or 0 if there is no environment for the port.

If the environment cannot be found or if the data obtained is invalid or
intended for another device, the device driver should extract user settings
from the WIN.INI file, by using the profile string functions documented in
the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit. However, the driver should
contain useful defaults for all strings, so that it can create a valid
environment even if the WIN.INI file is empty.

The driver should use the device name string at the beginning of the DEVMODE
structure to determine whether or not the environment obtained from
GetEnvironment() is correct.

A driver may also maintain additional information in its DEVMODE structure
to determine validity if the device name matches one the driver supports.


5.3.3  The SetEnvironment() Function

If the environment was not found, the driver should set the environment so
that future DCs created with the driver can use the environment. This is
accomplished with the SetEnvironment() call, which is declared as follows:

  WORD FAR PASCAL SetEnvironment(
  LPSTR  lpPort,
  LPDEVMODE lpDevMode,
  WORD   cbDevMode);

Similar to the GetEnvironment() function, the lpPort parameter points to the
output port for which the environment is being maintained, lpDevMode points
to the driver data, and cbDevMode contains the length. If cbDevMode is zero,
the environment is deleted entirely. The return value is the number of bytes
copied, -1 if the environment is being deleted, or 0 if an error occurs.

The driver should always set up the default environment if it is not
present, except when the driver is initialized with a non-default
environment (i.e., the lpInitData parameter to Enable() points to
application-supplied data).


5.3.4  The DeviceMode() Function

All printer drivers are required to export a function called DeviceMode(),
which pops up a dialog box to edit the default environment. This function
sets the profile strings in the WIN.INI file for the options chosen by the
user. It should also set the environment using the SetEnvironment()
function.

DeviceMode() is declared as follows:

  WORD FAR PASCAL DeviceMode(
          HWND    hWnd,
   HANDLE  hInstance,
   LPSTR   lpDevice,
   LPSTR   lpPort);

This is the only function ever called directly by an application and the
only function that does not involve any GDI or driver data structures such
as PDEVICE.

Since the function must pop up a dialog box with which the user can modify
printer settings, the application supplies the dialog's parent window with
the hWnd parameter. The application also supplies the module handle of the
driver DLL in the hInstance parameter. The lpDevice parameter points to the
device name (e.g., PCL / HP Laserjet), and lpPort points to the output port.


The DeviceMode() function needs to use the Windows API for dialog boxes,
which is described fully in the Systems Application Architecture, Common
User Access: Advanced Interface Design Guide. This document describes the
suggested appearance and user interface for the Setup dialog box.

The most common way to call DeviceMode() is with the Control Panel
application. However, other applications that make heavy use of printer
output, such as Microsoft Write or Microsoft Excel, may also provide a means
for calling the printer driver's DeviceMode() function.


5.3.5  The ExtDeviceMode() and DeviceCapabilities() Functions

Newer drivers also export two environment-related functions: ExtDeviceMode()
and DeviceCapabilities(). These two functions are part of the new
environment conventions for Windows 3.0, which were designed to allow
greater application control over the printer environment. All printer
drivers should implement these functions.

ExtDeviceMode() enables the application to call the driver to obtain device
initialization data either from the user or from the application's
modifications to the default environment.

DeviceCapabilities() enables the application to get information about such
things as what DeviceMode() fields the driver uses and what limits, ranges,
or selections are valid.

See the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for complete
documentation on the new Windows 3.0 device initialization convention.


5.4  Print Manager Support

A printer driver does not need to manipulate any hardware. Windows handles
all the port output for the driver, either directly or through the Print
Manager. GDI contains several functions a device driver can call to perform
output. The driver does not need to know if output is being queued or
written directly to the port.


5.4.1  The OpenJob() Function

To create a print job, a driver calls the OpenJob() function, which is
defined as follows:

  HANDLE FAR PASCAL OpenJob(LPSTR lpOutput, LPSTR lpTitle, HDC hdc);

The output will be sent to the port or file specified by lpOutput. This
information is passed to the driver during the Enable() call. The lpTitle
parameter points to an application-supplied title for the document; this
title appears in the Print Manager display. The hdc parameter is the
application's device context, i.e., the GDI handle for the application's
print job.

The lpTitle and hdc parameters are obtained from the application via job
control calls made to the driver from the application. This mechanism is
described in detail in Section 5.5, "The Control() Function."

The return value from OpenJob() is a handle used by the driver to refer to
the printer job in other GDI calls. If the return value is one of the
negative numbers defined in the following subsection, an error has occurred.



5.4.2  The StartSpoolPage() and EndSpoolPage() Functions

Printer output is divided into pages. Each page is stored in a temporary
file on the machine's hard disk when Print Manager is running. Dividing a
print job into pages allows Print Manager to begin printing one page while
the driver is still generating output on later pages. A Print Manager page
does not need to correspond to a physical page of printed output; the
division is the driver's decision.

When Print Manager is not running, page division is not very important since
temporary files are not involved. However, starting and ending to at least
one Print Manager page is still required.

There are two calls for manipulating Print Manager pages:

  int FAR PASCAL StartSpoolPage(HANDLE hJob);

  int FAR PASCAL EndSpoolPage(HANDLE hJob);

Calls to StartSpoolPage() and EndSpoolPage() can occur at any point during
the output. Some drivers use one spool page per physical page. Others use
one page for the whole job. Notice that the printing of a particular page by
the Print Manager application does not begin until it receives the
corresponding EndSpoolPage() call.

A driver can perform output at any point between these two calls. When
EndSpoolPage() is called and Print Manager is loaded, the page's temporary
file is submitted to the Windows Print Manager.

Both functions return a status code. Positive values indicate success.
Negative values indicate that an error has occurred. The defined error
conditions are as follows:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Error code                        Definition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SP_ERROR                          General error condition.

SP_APPABORT                       The application aborted the job by
                                  returning FALSE
                                  to GDI from an application-supplied
                                  function.

SP_USERABORT                      The user deleted the job via the Print
                                  Manager
                                  application.

SP_OUTOFDISK                      There is not enough disk space to create
                                  or extend
                                  the Print Manager temporary file.
Error code                        Definition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  the Print Manager temporary file.

SP_OUTOFMEMORY                    The function failed due to a low memory
                                  condition.



These status values are returned by all the Print Manager-supported GDI
calls.


5.4.3  The WriteSpool() and WriteDialog() Functions

There are two functions for performing output:

  int FAR PASCAL WriteSpool(HANDLE hJob, LPSTR lpData, WORD cch);

  int FAR PASCAL WriteDialog(HANDLE hJob, LPSTR lpMsg, WORD cch);

WriteSpool() is the function used to output device data to the port or Print
Manager temporary file. It must be called after a call to StartSpoolPage()
and before the corresponding EndSpoolJob().

The hJob parameter is a handle returned by OpenJob(), lpData is a far
pointer to the device-dependent data to write, and cch is the number of
bytes to write.

WriteDialog() is used by a driver to pop up a message box at a certain point
in the print job. For example, a driver for a printer using manual paper
loading can call WriteDialog() to ask the user to place a new sheet in the
printer. The print job will not continue printing until the user presses the
OK button in the message box. The user may also click a Cancel button to
terminate the print job.


5.4.4  The CloseJob() and DeleteJob() Functions

There are two ways to terminate a print job. Normally, a driver calls the
CloseJob() function,

  int FAR PASCAL CloseJob(HANDLE hJob);

Here, hJob is the handle returned by OpenJob(). The return value is either
positive if no errors occurred or it is one of the error codes defined in
Section 5.4.2.

If the driver detects an error condition or is asked to terminate a job by
the application (as described in Section 5.5, "The Control() Function"), the
driver will call DeleteJob().

  int FAR PASCAL DeleteJob(HANDLE hJob, WORD wDummy);

The hJob parameter is the job handle returned from OpenJob(). The wDummy
parameter is currently unused.

The return value is positive if the job is successfully deleted, or is one
of the negative status values if an error occurs.


5.5  The Control() Function

The Print Manager functions in GDI are often called when the printing
application performs job control actions, such as starting a job or
inserting a page break. All of these special functions go through the
Control() function, which is declared as follows:

short FAR PASCAL Control(LPPDEVICE lpPDevice, WORD nFunction,  LPSTR
lpInData, LPSTR lpOutData);

The lpPDevice parameter points to the PDEVICE structure maintained by the
device driver, which was initialized during the Enable() call.

The nFunction parameter contains the index of a device-dependent operation
to perform.

The lpInData parameter is a far pointer to input data defined by the
function specified by nFunction.

The lpOutData parameter points to a buffer for output data, if required.

The specific subfunctions are often called escapes, since the application
calls the driver's Control() function through the GDI function Escape().
Notice, however, that GDI modifies some escapes before calling Control().
This chapter will focus on those escapes that are common to most or all
printer drivers.

A complete list of all the escapes appears in Chapter 11, "Device Driver
Escapes." The driver writer should consult that chapter for details on all
the Control() subfunctions.

Notice that similar documentation appears in the Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit (SDK). However, applications call through the GDI Escape()
function, which has different parameters, and the behavior of some escapes
differs between the driver and the application because of GDI interaction.
For this reason, whenever there are any disagreements between the two
documents, this document should be used when dealing with the driver's
Control() function, and the SDK should be used when calling Escape() from a
Windows application.

The return value from Control() depends on the particular escape being
called. In general, positive values indicate success, negative values
indicate an error, and zero can indicate either an unimplemented escape or a
general error condition.

Some escapes that copy data of an indeterminate length to a buffer addressed
by lpOutData return the number of bytes (or array elements, etc.) copied or,
if lpOutData is NULL, the size of the data that would be copied if lpOutData
contained a non-NULL pointer. This would allow the application to query for
the size of a buffer to allocate before actually calling the escape.

When an escape uses negative values to indicate an error, the driver should
use the predefined SP_* values whenever appropriate, especially when the
Print Manager library functions are involved. The Control() function should
always return zero (i.e., unimplemented) for escapes that are unimplemented
or unrecognized.


5.5.1  The QUERYESCSUPPORT Escape

All drivers are required to implement the QUERYESCSUPPORT escape. For this
escape, lpInData points to a WORD that contains the index of another escape.


The driver must return a positive number if the driver implements that
escape, or zero if the escape is unimplemented. The driver always returns
non-zero if the escape queried for is QUERYESCSUPPORT.


5.5.2  The SETABORTPROC Escape

SETABORTPROC is the first escape an application calls when actually
printing. An application calling the GDI function Escape() for the
SETABORTPROC escape passes a pointer to a callback function in lpInData.
This callback function is used to check for user actions such as aborting
the print job. The printer driver, however, is not responsible for the
callback function; GDI modifies the SETABORTPROC escape so that lpInData
points to the application's device context handle.

The hDC parameter given to the driver by this escape should be used with the
OpenJob() function to enable the output functions in GDI to call the
application's abort procedure. Printer drivers generally save this handle in
the PDEVICE structure. If the application does not use SETABORTPROC, NULL
should be passed to the OpenJob() function.


5.5.3  The STARTDOC Escape

Usually, STARTDOC is the next escape an application calls. STARTDOC
indicates to GDI and the device driver that the application is actually
interested in printing and is not just querying the printer DC for
information.

This escape also supplies a Print Manager job title in a NULL-terminated
string pointed to by lpInData. The lpOutData parameter is unused. This
supplies the title used by the OpenJob() function.

Together with the port name supplied as a parameter to Enable() and the HDC
supplied by the SETABORTPROC escape, the driver now has all the data
necessary to call OpenJob().


5.5.4  Raster vs. Vector Devices

From this point, there are two paths the driver can take, depending on the
printer technology. Many printers (such as dot matrix and most laser
printers) are raster printers, i.e., they print out text and graphics as
bitmaps or raster lines.

Other devices (such as plotters and PostScript-based printers) are vector
devices, which draw text and graphics as a sequence of vectors or lines.
(Although PostScript printers are based on raster engines, the language
itself is vector oriented except where bitmaps are concerned.)

Raster devices usually have constraints that cause problems for implementing
the full GDI device model. Raster devices, for example, do not implement any
vector graphics operations. Therefore, all vector graphics must be drawn
into a bitmap before they are sent to the printer. Some devices, such as dot
matrix printers, do not allow the driver to print anywhere on the page. They
require that text and graphics be output in the order of the print direction
position on the page.

These bitmaps can be enormous for a device such as a 300 dpi laser printer.
In such cases, the driver can break up the page into smaller rectangles that
are printed individually. For each of the rectangles, GDI or the application
will draw all the graphics that fit in each rectangle into a bitmap and,
then, print each individual bitmap.

These rectangles are called bands, and the printing process that uses these
bands is called banding. It is usually necessary to band raster printers;
however, banding is not necessary for vector devices.

For vector devices (i.e., non-banding devices), the application calls GDI
graphics functions, which are translated into device driver graphics
primitives (see Section 5.7, "Performing Output," for further details).
After each page, the application uses the NEWFRAME escape to eject the page.
NEWFRAME uses neither lpInData nor lpOutData.


5.5.5  Using Banding Drivers

With banding drivers, there are two ways for a driver to do printing. An
application can either treat the driver as if it were a non-banding device
by calling the GDI functions and ending each page with the NEWFRAME escape,
in which case GDI performs the banding, or it can handle the banding itself.


The NEXTBAND Escape

In either case, the view from the driver is similar. Before any graphics are
drawn, the driver is called upon to perform the NEXTBAND escape. When
Control() is called for the NEXTBAND escape, lpInData points to a POINT
structure, and lpOutData points to a RECT structure. The driver should
initialize its band bitmap and set the RECT structure to the size, in device
coordinates, of the rectangle that the band represents on the page.

The POINT structure is added by GDI to determine the scaling factor for
graphics output. Some devices support the use of graphics at a lower
resolution than text to allow for faster output. The x-coordinate of the
POINT corresponds to horizontal scaling and the y-coordinate to vertical
scaling.

The value in the structure corresponds to a shift count. A point of (0,0)
specifies graphics at the same density as text, whereas a point of (1,1)
specifies half-density graphics in both directions, e.g., a 300 dpi laser
printer printing bitmaps at 150 dpi.

The driver's output function is then called to perform output into the band
bitmap. When all the output for the band is finished, the driver is called
for another NEXTBAND escape. The driver outputs the band in the band bitmap,
reinitializes the bitmap, sets a new rectangle, and continues with the next
band as it did with the first.

When all the bands on the page are exhausted, and the driver receives a
NEXTBAND escape, it should output the last graphics band and, then, set the
rectangle pointed to by lpOutData to (0,0,0,0) to indicate that there are no
more bands on the page. It should also perform all the processing necessary
to eject the completed page. The next NEXTBAND escape will correspond to the
first band of the next page.

If the application performs banding, it will call Escape() to get the band
rectangles. If GDI is handling banding on behalf of an application, then GDI
collects all the graphics calls on a page into a metafile, i.e., a temporary
file containing a list of the graphics calls and their parameters. When the
application calls Escape() to perform the NEWFRAME escape, GDI turns this
escape into a sequence of NEXTBAND calls to Control(). GDI sets the clip
region for the actual printer DC to the band rectangle and, then, plays back
the metafile, which recreates all of the application's output in the band
bitmap. GDI does this for each band until the band rectangle returned by the
driver is empty.

Some devices, such as raster laser printers, allow text to be placed
anywhere on the page at any time. Furthermore, these printers do not place
text into the band bitmap, since all the device fonts exist in printer or
cartridge memory. To optimize text output, their drivers use a single,
full-page band for all the text output and a sequence of smaller bands for
bitmapped graphics.

As an optimization, some of these drivers maintain a flag to detect whether
or not any output, other than text, is attempted during the first, full-page
band. If not, the driver skips the graphics bands.


The BANDINFO Escape

Some devices, such as laser printers, can print text and graphics anywhere
on the page but still require banding support for vector graphics
operations. Since these devices usually use their own internal device fonts,
they can greatly improve their text printing performance by using a single,
full-page band for text only as the first band. The driver ignores graphics
calls during this band and handles only ExtTextOut() or StrBlt() calls.
Graphics are printed on subsequent, smaller bands.

An application that is aware of this process can speed up its printing
operation by determining whether text or graphics will be printed on the
current band. It may do so using the BANDINFO escape. The application can
also use BANDINFO to optimize the banding process.

For the BANDINFO escape, both lpInData and lpOutData point to the
BANDINFOSTRUCT structure:

  typedef _bandinfostruct {
   BOOL fGraphics;
   BOOL fText;
   RECT rcGraphics;
   } BANDINFOSTRUCT;

The application calls BANDINFO immediately after NEXTBAND. If lpOutData is
non-NULL and graphics will be printed in the current band, the driver will
set the fGraphics flag in the output structure. If text will be printed, the
fText flag will be non-zero. The rcGraphics flag is not used for output.

Therefore, on the first band, the driver would set the rectangle returned by
NEXTBAND to the whole page. If it receives a BANDINFO escape, it will set
fText and clear fGraphics.

On subsequent bands, it will band the page in small rectangles, handle only
graphics calls, and, if the application calls BANDINFO, clear fText and set
fGraphics.

The application can also optimize the banding process somewhat by describing
the page with the structure passed by lpInData. The application sets the
fGraphics flag, if there are any graphics on the page, and the fText flag if
there is any text. If there are no graphics, the driver may be able to skip
the graphics bands. The application should also set rcGraphics to the
rectangle bounding all non-text graphics on the page. The driver has the
option of banding only the specified graphics rectangle rather than the
whole page.

Vector fonts complicate the process somewhat. Since vector devices using
banding generally cannot print vector fonts, these fonts are simulated using
polylines or scanlines. Therefore, they appear to the driver to be graphics
in the text band. Since vector fonts can appear anywhere on the page and
require graphics banding support, the driver must band graphics on the whole
page even if the BANDINFOSTRUCT passed by the application specifies
otherwise.

If the application never calls BANDINFO, the driver can decide whether or
not to band graphics by maintaining a flag that is set if any graphics calls
are seen during the text band. See Chapter 11, "Device Driver Escapes," for
complete documentation on the escapes.


5.5.6  The ENDDOC and ABORTDOC Escapes

When an application has completed all output, it calls the ENDDOC escape.
ENDDOC does not use either lpInData or lpOutData. At this point, the driver
may call CloseJob().

Another common escape is ABORTDOC, which is also called ABORTPIC in older
documentation or applications and has the same number assigned. This escape
allows GDI or the application to abort a print job. Generally, if the job is
valid, the driver will clean up and call DeleteJob().


5.5.7  Final Notes on Escapes

Few, if any, applications use QUERYESCSUPPORT to look for SETABORTPROC,
STARTDOC, NEWFRAME, ENDDOC, or ABORTDOC. Therefore, a printer driver should
handle all of these escapes.

In addition, there are a few applications that perform banding without
verifying that banding is required either by using QUERYESCSUPPORT or the
GetDeviceCaps() function (which examines the GDIINFO structure). A
non-banding driver can easily support such an application by returning the
full page as the band rectangle on the first NEXTBAND call and returning an
empty rectangle for the next NEXTBAND call and ejecting the page.

There are a large number of other escapes that may or may not be appropriate
to a specific driver. They are all listed alphabetically and described in
detail in Chapter 11, "Device Driver Escapes."


5.6  GDI Graphics Objects

Applications use the GDI graphics objects to perform drawing operations. The
objects that a printer driver needs to be aware of are the following:


  ■   Pens

  ■   Brushes

  ■   Fonts




5.6.1  Logical and Physical Objects

Applications create logical objects that are device-independent forms of
graphics tools. Physical objects are device-dependent representations of the
same tools that are passed to the driver to perform output. The process of
converting a logical object into a physical object is called realizing the
object. A physical object may be used many times for drawing. The
realization process is used to eliminate the overhead of converting a
logical to a physical object at the time of output.

Applications use the SelectObject() function to select logical objects into
a device context for use in drawing.

GDI and the driver convert the logical object into a physical object. GDI
first queries the driver for the size of a given physical object and, then,
allocates storage for it and calls the driver to perform the realization.

The contents and organization of the data structure defining a physical
object are completely up to the driver writer. Usually, the data structure
for the physical object includes the logical object plus some other
information that the driver needs.


5.6.2  Device Objects

Most drivers will also maintain and manipulate device objects. Device
objects are data structures that represent a graphic primitive that the
device supports very well.

The most common type of device object is a device font. Most printers are
capable of printing some set of built-in fonts. The concept of device fonts
enables drivers and applications to take advantage of a device's ability to
render fonts. Device fonts are also expected to produce better results
(print faster and look better) than GDI fonts.

However, drivers may also wish to support GDI raster and vector fonts. For
banding devices, it is usually not difficult to support GDI raster fonts
because GDI contains support functions to render raster fonts into
monochrome band bitmaps. GDI raster fonts are most useful for devices (such
as lower-resolution dot matrix printers) with resolutions near those of the
display.

For non-banding devices, supporting GDI raster fonts is not as easy. In
fact, the PostScript driver (a non-banding device) does not support GDI
raster fonts.

Supporting vector fonts is also optional. If a driver does not support
vector fonts, GDI will simulate them by drawing line segments.


5.6.3  The Information Functions

The functions discussed in this section are used to provide GDI and
applications with information about the driver and the device. They do the
following:


  ■   Realize objects

  ■   Enumerate objects

  ■   Translate logical and physical colors

  ■   Determine character widths




The RealizeObject() Function

Physical objects are created to avoid the overhead of translating logical
objects to physical ones at drawing time. A realized object can be used to
perform many drawing operations. Therefore, the RealizeObject() function
should produce physical objects that can be used with minimal overhead by
the output functions. RealizeObject(), not the output functions, should
perform any operations (such as translating or converting) that would slow
down the output functions.


The EnumDFonts() Function

EnumDFonts() is used to enumerate all the device fonts. It is passed a face
name that refers to the device font to enumerate.

The first call to EnumDFonts() passes a NULL face name. This indicates that
the driver should enumerate each face name that it supports. Subsequent
calls will pass in one of these face names. The driver should then enumerate
all the sizes of that font.


The EnumObj() Function

EnumObj() is used to enumerate all the pens and brushes that a device
supports. The enumeration process communicates logical descriptions of
objects to the application. All these objects must be unique, i.e., when
translated into physical objects and used for drawing, they should produce
different output.

All the styles and colors of pens and brushes should be enumerated. Since
pens are defined to be only pure colors, only logical colors that will
translate to pure physical colors should be enumerated. For devices that
support many colors (e.g., 8-bit displays), only a subset of all the colors
should be enumerated.


The ColorInfo() Function

ColorInfo() is used to translate physical and logical color representations.
It will translate in both directions, i.e., from physical to logical and
from logical to physical. When given a logical color, the nearest physical
color should be returned. When given a physical color, the logical color
that best describes that color should be returned. This function is used to
support the GDI function GetNearestColor().


The GetCharWidth() Function

GetCharWidth() is used to determine character widths for variable width
fonts. It is important that the values returned by this function match and
that the actual widths be used when displaying characters on the display
surface. Any differences will produce misalignments, and any text formatting
or justification will not work as intended.


5.6.4  The Information Brute Functions

When manipulating either banding bitmaps or memory bitmaps created by the
application, each of the preceding functions should check to see if the
PDEVICE passed indicates that a memory bitmap, rather than the actual
device, is referenced. If this is the case, the equivalent brute function
(for dot-matrix support) should be called, passing on all the parameters. In
the case of the banding driver, the brute functions are also called for the
main output device as well as for the memory bitmaps.

The following brute functions take the same parameters and return values as
the corresponding driver functions and actually call the display driver to
manipulate monochrome memory bitmaps:


  ■   dmRealizeObject()

  ■   dmEnumDFonts()

  ■   dmEnumObject()

  ■   dmColorInfo()


For graphics, most raster drivers call the dmColorInfo() function to map
colors. Display drivers then add together the three color components (R, G,
and B). If the weighted, average color value of these components is equal to
or greater than 128, then the color maps to white. Otherwise, it maps to
black.

The IBM Color Printer driver does the same thing in monochrome mode.
However, in color mode, each color is compared individually to the 128
value. The HPPCL driver is only adjustable for text.

Notice that the following colors all map to white on EGA, VGA, and 8514/a
displays:


  ■   Light Grey

  ■   Green

  ■   Yellow

  ■   Magenta

  ■   Cyan


For further information on the RGB data structure and how to calculate these
color values, see Section 12.2.3, "RGB ─ Logical Color Specification."


5.7  Performing Output

There is a relatively small set of functions used for performing output.
These functions take as parameters a destination device, parameters that
control the output, and physical objects that have been realized previously.


How the output functions are implemented depends on whether or not the
device uses banding. Banding devices have their output stored in a metafile.
This metafile is replayed for every band that is rendered (either by GDI or
applications that wish to implement banding). Therefore, output coordinates
must be mapped into the current band, and output outside of the band must be
clipped.

Non-banding devices perform output to the device in one pass. Therefore, the
device must have access to the entire display surface. Drivers must be able
to perform all the output functions to both the display surface and to
memory bitmaps. This restriction would make it very difficult for devices
that supported complex drawing primitives if it were not for the help that
GDI and the display driver supply.


5.7.1  The GDI Output Brute Functions

GDI provides a set of functions that correspond to many of the required
driver functions that are designed to manipulate monochrome memory bitmaps.
These functions are useful for performing output to memory bitmaps and for
manipulating band bitmaps in banding drivers. The names of these functions
are similar to those of the corresponding driver function except for the
addition of a dm prefix, which stands for dot matrix. They are also known as
brute functions.

Nonbanding drivers (such as PostScript or a plotter driver) use the brute
functions to support memory bitmaps. Whenever a pointer to the driver's
PDEVICE structure is passed to the driver, GDI may substitute a pointer to a
BITMAP structure. The driver can differentiate between the two cases because
the first WORD (bmType) of a BITMAP structure must be zero, whereas the
first WORD (often called epType) of a PDEVICE structure must be non-zero. If
this first WORD is zero, the driver simply passes the same arguments through
to the corresponding brute function and returns its return value.

Banding drivers operate by using a memory bitmap to simulate the display
surface. Therefore, a banding driver calls the brute function with a pointer
to a BITMAP structure that defines the band bitmap. The driver also has to
translate some coordinate parameters from device coordinates to bitmap
coordinates since, in general, there will be many bands in different
positions on a page of output. The brute functions, however, always use
coordinates relative to the bitmap, i.e., (0,0) to (bmWidth, bmHeight).

Therefore, many output functions may take the following form:

  Function(LPDEVICE lpDevice, ... )
  {
      if (!lpDevice-&gt;epType)
        {
          /* output to memory bitmap */
          return dmFunction(lpDevice, ... );
        }
      /* if this is a nonbanding driver, perform
       * device specific output. Otherwise, for a
       * banding driver,
       */

      /* transform coordinates according to band position
       */
      somerandomxcoordinate -= lpDevice-&gt;xBandPosition;
      somerandomycoordinate -= lpDevice-&gt;yBandPosition;

      /* assume that a BITMAP structure is stored somewhere in
       * the PDEVICE for the band bitmap
       */
      lpDevice = (LPDEVICE)&amp;lpDevice-&gt;epBandBmpHdr;

      return dmFunction(lpDevice, ... );
  }

The sample sources on the DDK disks provide specific examples for all the
brute functions.

The brute functions operate by calling the corresponding display driver
function to manipulate a memory bitmap. Therefore, they have exactly the
same parameters as the corresponding driver functions, with the exception
that the lpDevice parameters are always assumed to point to memory BITMAP
structures.

Since driver capabilities and bitmap formats vary from display to display,
the printer driver should use the brute functions only for monochrome (not
color) bitmaps. Also, since the PC_SCANLINE and LC_POLYLINE capabilities are
required for all display drivers, the printer driver can assume that at
least these capabilities are in the brute function.

The following brute functions are available for output:


  ■   dmBitBlt()

  ■   dmOutput()

  ■   dmPixel()

  ■   dmStrBlt()

  ■   dmScanLR()


Notice that there is currently no dmExtTextOut() function; ExtTextOut() must
be implemented by the driver.


5.7.2  The GDI Color Library Functions

The dot-matrix (brute) library functions in GDI, such as dmBitBlt() and
dmOutput(), are written for monochrome printers and do not support color. To
simplify the writing of color drivers, source code for a color version of
the required functions is supplied with the DDK.

This color library implements color versions of all the dm*() functions
except dmTranspose(), which does not depend on color format. The arguments
and return values of these functions are the same as those for the GDI
monochrome versions of these functions.

The library implements color using a 3-plane RGB (Red, Green, Blue) banding
bitmap, which is converted to CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) when the
bitmap is sent to the printer. If your printer requires a different format,
you will need to modify the supplied sources for your driver.

A sample printer driver is supplied for the IBM PC Color Printer. This
driver is similar in structure to the sample Epson driver and has several
files in common with it.

If you are modifying or upgrading a driver written for Windows 2.x to
support Windows 3.0, you should be aware of modifications made to these
libraries for protected-mode memory-management support. Both dmBitBlt() and
dmOutput() compile short, efficient functions into the stack segment and,
then, call them to perform the actual operation. In protected mode, this
requires creating a CS alias for the stack segment. (See Section 5.9,
"Updating 2.x Printer Drivers to 3.0," for more information on memory
management and code and data segment mixing.) This is performed at the
beginning of the two functions.

A selector must be allocated for these two functions to operate. It is
stored in the global ScratchSelector, which is external to the library and
which must be supplied by the driver. In the sample IBM PC Color Printer
driver, it is allocated and freed in Enable() and Disable(), respectively.
These functions appear in the file RESET.C. The code for the affected
library functions appears in BITBLT.ASM and OUTPUT.ASM.


5.7.3  The GDI dmTranspose() Function

The GDI library of dot-matrix supporting functions also provides a function
for those drivers that need to transpose bitmaps. For example, many
dot-matrix printers print graphics eight scanlines at a time, in which each
byte printed corresponds to one column of pixels.

The dmTranspose() function takes the following three parameters:

╓┌───────────────┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Parameter       Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpSource        A long pointer to the source buffer.
lpDest          A long pointer to the destination buffer.
WidthBytes      The number of bytes per scanline in the bitmap.


The dmTranspose() function assumes that neither buffer exceeds 64K or
crosses a segment boundary and that the two buffers are disjoint.

The number of bytes affected by dmTranspose() is 8*WidthBytes. The first
byte in the destination buffer consists of the most significant bit of the
first byte in each of the first eight scanlines in the source buffer. The
second byte will take the second most significant bit from the first byte in
each of eight scanlines. When eight destination bytes have been produced,
corresponding to all the bits in the first byte of each source scanline, the
second group of eight source bytes will be transposed.

If WidthBytes is positive, then the bits from the first scanline are
transposed to the corresponding most-significant bit of the destination
bytes. If it is negative, then the absolute value is used as the width of
the bitmap, and the bits from the first scanline are transposed to the
corresponding least-significant bit of the destination.

For example, if lpSource points to a buffer such as the following one:

 10100000 ...  10100000 ...  10100000 ...  10100000 ...  00000000 ...
00001111 ...  00000000 ...  00001111 ...

Then, if WidthBytes is positive, lpDest will be set to the following:

 11110000 00000000 11110000 00000000  00000101 00000101 00000101 00000101

However, if WidthBytes is negative, lpDest will be set to the following:

 00001111 00000000 00001111 00000000  10100000 10100000 10100000 10100000


5.7.4  The GDI Priority Queue Functions

The GDI library provides the priority queue data type that is used with
device-specific fonts to sort output strings into the correct order on the
page. Priority queues are accessed through a two-byte value, known as the
"key." Each key can also have two bytes of information, called a "tag,"
associated with it.

The following list provides brief descriptions of each of the priority queue
functions.

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Function                          Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Function                          Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CreatePQ(size):hPQ                Creates a priority queue. Size, a short
                                  integer value, is the maximum number of
                                  items to be inserted into this priority
                                  queue. hPQ is a handle to the priority
                                  queue if the function is successful.
                                  Otherwise, hPQ is zero.

MinPQ(hPQ):tag                    Returns the tag associated with the key
                                  having the smallest value in the priority
                                  queue, without removing this element from
                                  the queue.

ExtractPQ(hPQ):tag                Returns the tag associated with the key
                                  having the smallest value in the priority
                                  queue and removes the key from the queue.

InsertPQ(hPQ, tag, key):Result    Inserts the key and its associated tag
                                  into the priority queue. Result, a short
                                  integer value, is TRUE if the insertion is
Function                          Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  integer value, is TRUE if the insertion is
                                  successful. Otherwise, it is ERROR(-1).

SizePQ(hPQ, sizechange):Result    Increases or decreases the size of the
                                  priority queue. Sizechange is a short
                                  integer value specifying the number of
                                  entries to be added or removed. Result,
                                  also a short integer value, is the number
                                  of entries that can be accommodated by the
                                  resized priority queue. Result is ERROR(-1)
                                  if the resulting size is smaller than the
                                  actual number of elements in the priority
                                  queue.

DeletePQ(hPQ):Result              Deletes a priority queue. Result, a short
                                  integer value, is TRUE if the queue is
                                  deleted. Otherwise, it is ERROR(-1).




5.7.5  Interpreting GDI Coordinates

Drivers must be careful to interpret properly the coordinates that GDI
passes to the output functions. GDI uses an upper-left inclusive and
lower-right exclusive rectangle. Therefore, the rectangle coordinates
(0,0,3,3) imply the type of fill shown in Figure 5.1.

(This figure may be found in the printed book).

What this means is that the upper-left coordinates of a rectangle map to a
device pixel into which the driver should draw. The lower-right coordinates
are not drawn into. This concept is important to understand to avoid the
problems created by being "off by one."


5.7.6  Clipping Character Strings

Character strings should be clipped pixel-by-pixel like all other graphics,
whenever possible. Some types of printers, however, do not allow
pixel-precision clipping of device-based fonts. When this is the case, the
driver should clip character strings on a per-character basis.

To maintain consistency between drivers and applications, all drivers should
handle boundary conditions in the same manner. Therefore, any character that
is horizontally at least partly outside the clipping rectangle should be
completely clipped. However, a character whose horizontal extent falls
entirely within the clipping rectangle and whose vertical extent is at least
partly within the clipping rectangle should be printed. This means that, if
rcClip is the clipping rectangle and rcChar is the character cell, clipping
is performed as follows:

  if (rcChar.left &gt;= rcChar.left &amp;&amp; rcChar.right &lt;=rcClip.right
       &amp;&amp; rcChar.top &lt;rcClip.bottom &amp;&amp; rcChar.bottom &gt;rcClip.top)
     {
    /* this character will be printed */
     }
   else
     {
    /* this character is clipped from the output */
     }


5.7.7  Output Functions Summary

To create output, GDI calls the following driver functions and their
information functions. Detailed descriptions of the output functions appear
in Chapter 10, "Common Functions."


  ■   Output()

  ■   BitBlt()

  ■   StrBlt()

  ■   ExtTextOut()

  ■   Pixel()

  ■   ScanLR()


The display driver descriptions of these may also be useful for non-banding
devices that require a more detailed understanding of the semantics of these
functions. FastBorder() need not be implemented for printers. It is intended
only for displays.

Printers with special bitmap-manipulating abilities should support the new
Windows 3.0 DIBs functions. (See Section 3.4, "Device-Independent Bitmaps,"
for a more detailed description of the functions.)


5.8  Stub Functions

Since printer drivers are dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that GDI loads via
the LoadLibrary() function, they must also export the termination function
called WEP(bSystemExit), or Windows Exit Procedure. This function indicates
that all of Windows is shutting down or the DLL is being unloaded from the
system. More detailed descriptions are provided in Chapter 10, "Common
Functions," and in the SDK's Guide to Programming.

Printer drivers must also include the same two stub functions (i.e.,
SetAttribute and DeviceBitmap) for which sample code is provided in Chapter
2, "Display Drivers." Simply copy verbatim the code reproduced there.


5.9  Updating 2.x Printer Drivers to 3.0

Windows 3.0 offers several enhancements that affect printer drivers. The
following are those with the greatest effect and will be discussed in this
section:


  ■   Memory management

  ■   New device initialization conventions

  ■   New driver interface functions

  ■   Support for device-independent bitmaps (DIBs)

  ■   Support for version 3.0 format fonts on 80386-based computers




5.9.1  Memory Management

Memory management significantly affects printer drivers that are being
updated. Drivers that do not support the new Windows 3.0 printer driver
features will still run with Windows 3.0, although they will not be as
functional as fully updated drivers. However, drivers that are unaware of
the new Windows 3.0 protected-mode memory-management  requirements will
probably fail to operate at all.

Windows 3.0, in both standard and enhanced mode, takes advantage of
protected-mode memory management. This memory management is less tolerant of
the following kinds of driver bugs or practices:


  ■   References to NULL pointers

  ■   Reads and writes past the allocated length of segments

  ■   Mixing code and writable data in the same segment

  ■   Huge pointer arithmetic based on the overlapping segment architecture
      of the 8086 processor




Segment Overrun Problems

Another problem with the Windows 2.1 DDK sample sources was a
segment-overrun bug. Banding raster printer drivers, such as the Epson and
IBM graphic printer drivers, use the GDI function dmTranspose() when
converting the band bitmap to the printer's native command language. The
dmTranspose() function always converts eight rows at a time. Therefore,
drivers that output seven rows at a time generally do the following:


  ■   Transpose eight rows

  ■   Set the most significant bit to 1 or zero

  ■   Output that data

  ■   Then skip seven rows in the bitmap


That way, the next first row will be the last row that the previous pass
ignored.

This presents a problem for the last row. If a row has a (hypothetical)
width of 100 bytes, which corresponds to 800 pixels, then dmTranspose() will
access 800 bytes to convert eight rows. However, the last row will leave
only 700 bytes in the segment. In protected mode, the first access made by
dmTranspose() past the 700-byte limit will result in a GP fault. The
simplest solution is to add a row of "slop" bytes to the end of the band
bitmap, allowing dmTranspose() to function as expected.


Code and Data Segment Mixing

There is an additional problem that usually is only an issue for display
drivers, but that also affects color raster printer drivers (such as the
sample IBMCOLOR driver). Since the dot-matrix library (also referred to as
the "brute" functions) in GDI supports only monochrome bitmaps, color
drivers generally include their own version of these functions, which are
extended to support their particular bitmap format. These functions are
generally derived from the "color dot-matrix library" supplied with the DDK.


The BitBlt() and Output() functions work by compiling a short function that
efficiently implements the desired operation. These functions are written
into arrays allocated on the stack. To compile the function, it must appear
in a writable data segment (which the stack always is). However, to actually
call the function, it must be in a code segment (which the stack never is).
Thus, BitBlt() and Output() will cause a GP fault when attempting to call
the compiled function.

The solution is to create a CS alias. Normally, only one selector is used to
refer to a region of memory. However, if the descriptor for another selector
contains the same linear address and length as the original, accessing
either selector will refer to the same linear address. Then, if the new
selector is marked as a code segment, a program can call a function in that
segment.

Windows device drivers can call AllocSelector() to get an uninitialized
selector and ChangeSelector() to copy the base and length and the modified
attributes to the new selector. This is demonstrated in the color library
for the Windows 3.0 DDK.

If a printer driver is allocating read/write variables in a code segment, it
will encounter the same problem since the code segment is no longer
writable. In this case, the driver is probably better off placing the
variables in its default data segment. This is because the Windows KERNEL
always adjusts far-call entry prologs to point to the correct segment. It is
also generally considered poor programming practice to use a CS alias to
access code segment variables.


Huge Pointer Arithmetic and Selector Tiling

None of the printer drivers shipped as DDK sources has ever used segment
arithmetic for accessing objects greater than 64K at a time. However, if you
are updating a driver that does so, you will need to address this issue.

Windows 3.0 uses selector tiling to allow drivers (and applications) to
allocate objects larger than 64K and access them with 16-bit offsets. In
short, Windows will allocate multiple selectors (all 64K, if necessary,
except possibly the last one) and use selectors separated by some fixed
amount, represented by the variable __ahincr. In real mode, __ahincr is set
to 1000H, allowing the same code to execute in any memory configuration.

Selector tiling is explained in more detail in the Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit.


5.9.2  Device Initialization Conventions

A new device initialization convention adopted for Windows 3.0 printer
drivers allows applications much greater control over printer drivers. All
the sample printer drivers included with the DDK implement the new device
initialization convention. This convention is explained in detail in the
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit.

The convention adds to a printer driver the following two new functions:


  ■   ExtDeviceMode()

  ■   DeviceCapabilities()


ExtDeviceMode() enables applications to obtain device initialization data,
by optionally prompting the user or making device-independent modifications
to the initialization data, which can then be passed to the CreateDC()
function. GDI then calls the Enable() function with a pointer to this
information, allowing the driver to preset its GDIINFO and PDEVICE
structures according to the application's options, rather than the defaults.
That way, the application can store different printer settings for itself
and its documents or even request specific setup properties, such as
orientation.

DeviceCapabilities() enables the application to get information about such
things as what DeviceMode() fields the driver uses and what limits, ranges,
or selections are valid.


5.9.3  Driver Interface Functions

There are a number of new functions that a driver can export for GDI's
benefit. They are used to support the new Device-Independent Bitmap (DIB)
format or to improve performance on certain GDI operations, such as
StretchBlt(). The functions include the following:


  ■   FloodFill()

  ■   SetDIBitsToDevice()

  ■   StretchBlt()

  ■   StretchDIBits()



5.9.4  Support for Device-Independent Bitmaps

Device-independent bitmaps (DIBs) are bitmaps in a new format that was
designed to provide a device-independent way for applications to transfer
bitmap images among a variety of output devices. Besides the bitmap bits,
these bitmaps contain color table information and additional dimension
information.

A device driver writer should consider adding support in his driver for
DIBs, especially on color devices. If a driver does not support DIBs, GDI
will simulate converting DIBs into the standard monochrome bitmap format and
output it using BitBlt(). While it is possible to write a driver without
DIBs support, the quality of DIBs output will rarely be satisfactory in that
situation.

Therefore, if a printer driver can do more with the bitmap, it should
attempt to support DIBs handling, especially if it can perform its own
half-toning or coloring of bitmaps. To enable such functionality, the driver
should support SetDIBitsToDevice() and StretchDIBits(), and possibly support
SetDIBits() and GetDIBits() if the driver deals with GDI bitmaps.

The format of DIBs and the driver functions to be implemented are discussed
in Chapter 3, "Display Drivers: New Features."


5.9.5  Support for Greater Than (&gt;) 64K Fonts

Some display drivers (including those shipped by Microsoft in the Windows
3.0 retail package) use a new format for fonts when running in protected
mode (with Windows running in either standard or 386 enhanced mode) on an
80386 or 80486-based computer. This format allows for larger (&gt;64K) fonts,
as well as some other options. In this situation, GDI will convert all the
2.x format fonts to the new format so that only one font file format is used
in memory.

If your printer driver prints GDI bitmap fonts, you may need to update your
driver. In many cases, your driver will not need to be updated if it is a
banding monochrome driver that uses only the brute functions (see Section
5.7.1, "The GDI Output Brute Functions"); these functions are already aware
of the new format.

If the driver contains code to access the font, you will need to update your
driver. If you have a color driver based on the color library, the library
in the Windows 3.0 DDK has been updated to support the new 3.0 format, as
well as the old 2.x format.

Details on the new font file support may be found in Chapter 12, "Data
Structures and File Formats," and Chapter 13, "The Font File Format."
Chapter 3, "Display Drivers: New Features," also has a discussion on &gt;64K
fonts support.


5.10  Printer Drivers Checklist

The following checklist is a summary of the points made in this chapter
along with some additional general information for updating all device
drivers.


  ■   To initialize a printer driver, you must implement the Enable()
      function and create the GDIINFO and PDEVICE data structures.

  ■   To provide the appropriate printer driver environment information, you
      must create the DEVMODE data structure and implement the following
      functions:

      DeviceMode()

      ExtDeviceMode()

      DeviceCapabilities()

  ■   To perform port output either directly or through the Print Manager,
      Windows can call the following GDI functions:

      OpenJob()

      StartSpoolPage()

      EndSpoolPage()

      WriteSpool()

      WriteDialog()

      CloseJob()

      DeleteJob()

  ■   To call the Print Manager functions in GDI, the application must call
      the driver's Control() function through the GDI Escape() function. The
      following are the most commonly used escapes for printer drivers:

      QUERYESCSUPPORT

      SETABORTPROC

      STARTDOC

      NEXTBAND

      NEWFRAME

      BANDINFO

      ENDDOC

      ABORTDOC

  ■   To perform drawing operations, applications use the GDI graphics
      objects. Printer drivers need to be aware of the following:

      Pens

      Brushes

      Fonts

      Device objects

      The distinction between logical and physical objects

      The information functions (RealizeObject(), EnumDFonts(), EnumObj(),
      ColorInfo(), and GetCharWidth())

      The information brute functions (the dot matrix (dm) versions of the
      preceding functions)

  ■   To create output, GDI calls the following driver functions and their
      information functions:

      Output()

      BitBlt()

      StrBlt()

      ExtTextOut()

      Pixel()

      ScanLR()

  ■   To generate output, the printer driver may call any of the following
      functions:

      The GDI output brute functions

      The GDI color library functions

      The GDI dmTranspose() function

      The GDI priority queue functions

  ■   The driver must also implement the following stub functions:

      SetAttribute()

      DeviceBitmap()

      WEP()

  ■   When updating a Windows 2.x printer driver to run under Windows 3.0,
      you must consider how the following enhancements will affect your
      driver:

      Memory management

      New device initialization conventions

      New driver interface functions

      Device-independent bitmaps support

      Greater than 64K fonts support

  ■   All Windows 3.0 drivers have to be bimodal, i.e., they have to run in
      protected mode as well as 8086 real address mode. To do so, you may
      need to use some of these functions from KERNEL:

      AllocSelector() ─ to get a selector

      FreeSelector(wSel) ─ to free a selector

      ChangeSelector(wSrcSel, wDestSel) ─ for code&lt;─&gt;data selector
      conversion

      AllocCSToDSAlias(wSel) ─ to get a data alias of the code selector

      AllocDSToCSAlias(wSel) ─ to get a code alias of the data selector

      __AHIncr ─ to do selector huge increments

      __GetWinFlags() ─ to get information on the CPU and Windows modes

  ■   To avoid general protection faults, do not do any of the following:

      Access (read or write) an array beyond its limits.

      Have an offset wrap-around (going from 0FFFFH to 0 using a string
      instruction).

      Load an invalid selector into a segment register.

      Update code segment variables.

      Do segment arithmetic (except as described) for selector registers.

      Compare segment (selector) registers to see which is lower in memory.

      Use undocumented MS-DOS calls. You should use Windows calls whenever
      possible.






Chapter 6  Network Support
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This chapter provides an overview of network support in Microsoft Windows
version 3.0 and contains descriptions of the following areas:


  ■   New benefits provided to network users

  ■   Issues that may cause incompatibilities between Windows and networks

  ■   How network vendors can make their software work well with Windows 3.0

  ■   Which networks are supported in Windows 3.0 and how such pieces are
      distributed



6.1  New Features

The following subsections detail the new support that Windows 3.0 offers to
network users.

Some basic restrictions still apply:


  ■   The user must start the network before starting Windows.

  ■   There is no support for workstations running Windows while also acting
      as servers.




6.1.1  Alleviating the Memory Crunch

The most pressing problem for Windows 2.x has been memory. Windows has
always been hampered by the 640K barrier, and loading network software
(typically between 50 and 150 KB) reduced available memory drastically.
Often, users find they need to choose between running large applications and
running their network.

Windows 3.0 solves this in the most dramatic way possible. Instead of
gradually decreasing memory requirements, the 640K barrier was removed
altogether. Both the standard and enhanced modes for Windows now run in
protected mode on the appropriate hardware, allowing Windows and Windows
applications to directly access all the memory on the system.

This by itself should solve 80 per cent of our customers' problems. However,
protected mode also brings along some new compatibility issues, which are
discussed in Section 6.3, "Compatibility Issues and Solutions."


6.1.2  Adding and Deleting Network Connections

Previous versions of Windows made it inconvenient for the user to change
network connections. Under Windows/286(tm), users had to start up a
non-Windows application (such as USE.EXE) to make the connection. Under
Windows/386(tm), we recommended that the user not even attempt to change
connections.

Under Windows 3.0, the user can:


  ■   Connect and disconnect network drives from File Manager.

  ■   Connect and disconnect network printers from Control Panel.


Both processes are integrated into the standard Windows user interface and
do not require spawning off any network utilities. They are actually
performed using calls to the network driver (described in Section 6.2.1,
"Windows User Interface: The Windows Network Driver"). See Figure 6.1 for an
example of creating a network connection by using the Connect Network Drive
dialog box.

(This figure may be found in the printed book).

On some networks, the user can browse through a list of the available
network resources and select ones to connect to. On all networks, the user
can save a list of commonly used connections and reconnect to them with a
minimum number of keystrokes.


6.1.3  Network Printing

The Windows Print Manager (formerly known as the Spooler) is now
network-aware. It handles local printers much as it did for version 2.x, but
it now recognizes network printers and manipulates them using the network
driver. (See Figure 6.2 for an example of a Print Manager dialog box.) This
allows the following four advantages:


  ■   Faster printing to network printers

  ■   The ability to view the contents and status of network print queues,
      including detailed information on each job

  ■   The ability to pause, resume, and delete your own jobs waiting in
      network print queues

  ■   Accurate and detailed network error messages

      (This figure may be found in the printed book).



6.1.4  Network Error Messages

In many cases, Windows can now give more accurate error messages when there
are network errors. This is most noticeable in Print Manager, but is also
seen under conditions such as network access violations and severe network
errors.


6.1.5  Network-Specific Dialog Functions

Control Panel allows the user to invoke a network-specific dialog box, which
can provide access to any additional features the network supports. For
example, the dialog box could allow the user to log in under a new name or
send messages to another user, if the network supports these operations.

The dialog box is provided by the network driver, and its design is
completely up to the developer. However, the design should follow the
guidelines described in the Systems Application Architecture, Common User
Access: Advanced Interface Design Guide, and Microsoft should be allowed to
review these designs via an OnLine service request before the drivers are
distributed. If this dialog box offers the user any options, some mechanism
should be included to enable the user to access on-line help. How to use the
Windows Help Engine is described in the Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit.

It is also the place where the driver version, copyright, and other
information can be displayed. We strongly recommend that this dialog box
provide some way for the user to learn the name of the network and the
version numbers of both the network software and the Windows network driver.



6.1.6  Running Windows From a Network Drive

Many corporations are choosing to put a single copy of Windows on the
network, rather than putting separate copies on every workstation. This is
much easier for MIS departments to maintain, upgrade, and control.

Under Windows 2.x, this was not feasible because the Windows files were
linked for particular hardware during Setup. Drivers and fonts were bound
together into a few large binary files (i.e., WIN200.BIN and WIN200.OVL),
and the entire Setup process had to be repeated to change the configuration.


In Windows 3.0, we have attempted to remove these barriers. All the
necessary drivers and fonts are left as separate files on the user's disk
(or the network Windows directory). The ones to be used for a particular
workstation are specified in the user's SYSTEM.INI file, and changing
configurations consists of nothing more than copying the proper files to the
user's disk (if not already there) and modifying entries in their .INI
files.

The advantage for networks is that a single Windows directory can contain
files for more than one configuration. Each file is left unmodified and with
its original name. A network administrator can install all the files their
users require, and individual users need only have their own personal
directory containing .INI and temporary files. The users can modify their
own .INI file (manually or using Setup) without affecting others using the
same software. This is possible because Setup has a special option to create
a personal directory that references the common Windows directory on a
network. (See the Microsoft Windows User's Guide for more information.)


6.1.7  Supporting Large Numbers of Outstanding NCBs

Previous versions of enhanced Windows imposed a limit on the number of
Network Control Blocks (NCBs) that could be outstanding. However, this limit
was too small for some network-intensive applications. The NetBIOS device
for enhanced Windows 3.0 now supports up to 4K of NCBs, which should be
adequate for most situations. This limit, however, can also be configured by
changing the NetHeapSize entry in the SYSTEM.INI file.


6.2  Attaining Compatibility

With previous versions of enhanced Windows, many network vendors had to
modify their network software to be "Windows/386 aware" for the two products
to coexist at all.

For the most part, that is still true with version 3.0. However, we now have
new alternatives and new problems that need to be confronted. Windows
running in enhanced mode has become much easier to support, but new steps
must be taken in all modes.


6.2.1  Windows User Interface: The Windows Network Driver

As described in Section 6.1, "New Features," the Windows Control Panel, File
Manager, and Print Manager provide the user with access to network
functions. To enable these to work under many different networks (each with
its own capabilities and API), we have designed a Windows network driver.
Just as a printer driver takes high-level calls designed for a mythical
"super printer" and maps them to calls understood by one specific printer,
the network driver takes a standard set of calls and translates them to the
API of one specific network.

The standard Windows package contains several drivers to support popular
networks. Microsoft provides support for Microsoft LAN Manager and a generic
driver for NetBIOS and Microsoft Network-based networks. Most networks based
on these products can use the standard drivers provided by Microsoft.
However, network vendors can also write custom drivers to take advantage of
their own features and extensions.

For each network, a single driver should be used for Windows in both real
and protected modes. The driver may also serve as a convenient place to put
other code unrelated to the functions it provides to Windows. Common
examples include the following:


  ■   Code that uses DPMI to map APIs between protected and real modes (as
      described in Section 6.3.4, "The Problem of Protected Mode API").

  ■   Entry points for high-level functions provided for network-specific
      Windows applications.


See Chapter 7, "Network Drivers," for more information on developing Windows
network drivers.


6.2.2  Enhanced Windows 3.0: Virtual Device Architecture

In previous versions of enhanced Windows, it was difficult to add support
for new configurations. It required the developer to modify code entwined
throughout the enhanced Windows core software and build a customized version
of the product. The changes made by one developer were incompatible with any
other versions.

For version 3.0, the entire system has been redesigned. Support for new
hardware or software configurations can be added in modular format, as
self-contained "virtual devices," which can be developed independently. Each
virtual device is a self-contained program module that can be distributed
and installed separately, can be loaded at runtime as needed, and can
cooperate with the other virtual devices in a harmonious way.

Microsoft also provides two network-related virtual devices: VNETBIOS (for
NetBIOS support) and DOSNET (for Microsoft Networks). Either may be
modified, extended, or replaced to fit your network's needs. Notice,
however, that the DOSNET device provides services that are also used by
other virtual devices. Therefore, it is standard practice to replace it with
a new device that has a different name, but which also uses the same device
ID as DOSNET. See the LDOSNET source code supplied on the DDK disks for more
details.

The Microsoft Windows Virtual Device Adaptation Guide contains more detailed
information on creating enhanced Windows virtual devices.


6.2.3  Standard Windows 3.0: The DOS Extender's Domain

For Windows 3.0 running in standard mode, the protected-mode operation not
only offers great benefits but also causes new compatibility problems.

Windows running in standard or real mode does not provide the same
sophisticated, extensible environment that enhanced Windows does. Luckily,
its needs are also not as great because it does not multitask non-Windows
applications. Most hardware devices will not require changes to the DOS
Extender; for example, displays are handled by the Windows "grabber," and
support for all major mice is already built into the standard DOS Extender.


However, some problems still exist. Just as with Windows 2.x, the problem of
asynchronous events still arises when switching between non-Windows
applications, and the problem of the protected-mode API occurs for Windows
applications calling the network. The second problem can be handled by
placing code in the network driver or other DLL, but the first may require
changes to both the DOS Extender and the non-Windows application support
module (i.e., WINOLDAP.) (Both of these problems are discussed in more
detail in Section 6.3, "Compatibility Issues and Solutions.")

The DOS Extender is an independent executable file distributed with Windows.
It takes care of changing the processor state between real and protected
modes, mapping APIs, and virtualizing system components that require global
supervision.

WINOLDAP is the component that understands about running and switching
between non-Windows applications. One of its functions is to prevent the
user from switching away from a non-Windows application that is using
asynchronous NetBIOS calls.

Both the DOS Extender and WINOLDAP include support specifically for NetBIOS.
Unfortunately, these modules are not easily adapted to support other network
API. If you have problems that are not addressed by the mechanisms discussed
in Section 6.3, "Compatibility Issues and Solutions," you may contact
Microsoft via OnLine to request additional information.


6.2.4  Testing Compatibility

The DDK's Installation and Update Guide includes guidelines for third
parties to follow to make sure their products work with Windows 3.0. There
are also a network test and a hardware compatibility test application
provided on the DDK disks to help track down the problems discussed in this
document. Documentation for these applications is provided in README files
located under the appropriate test directory.


6.3  Compatibility Issues and Solutions

The following subsections detail the major compatibility issues that existed
with Windows 2.x and now with version 3.0, along with recommended solutions
to these problems.


6.3.1  The Problem of Space

The biggest problem in running Windows with various networks has been lack
of space. In Windows version 3.0, this problem is eliminated by moving
Windows and Windows applications into protected mode, where they have access
to all the memory in the system, not just the first 640K.

However, while this solution is good for Windows applications, it does not
help non-Windows applications. The network software is global. It will
continue to take the same amount of memory from both Windows and non-Windows
applications. The difference is that, in the latter case, it is taking up n
kilobytes out of 640K, whereas from Windows applications it is taking n from
the much larger memory space available in protected mode.

One possibility opened up by the new architecture of Windows in 386 enhanced
mode is to move some or all of the new networking code out of conventional
memory altogether by writing it as a virtual device. While this network
configuration will work only while Windows is running, it has the potential
to remove completely all network space overhead from non-Windows
applications.


6.3.2  The Problem of Global EMS

Many networks are attempting to free up space for other applications by
loading portions of themselves into expanded memory (EMS).

Windows can coexist with most EMS systems found on 80286 machines because
they are supported by hardware and do not take control of the machine by
entering protected mode. This enables networks in EMS to coexist with
Windows in real and standard mode. However, on 80386 machines, we run into
two possible problems:


  ■   While running, enhanced Windows provides its own EMS emulation, which
      takes precedence over existing expanded memory managers. However,
      unless a cooperating EMS emulator is used, there can be no EMS
      continuity before, during, and after enhanced Windows is run.

  ■   Windows cannot run in protected mode at the same time as other
      protected-mode software, including EMS emulators for the 80386
      processor.


In many cases, these problems will prevent global software (such as MS-DOS
or a network) from using EMS in situations where you need to run Windows.

However, Microsoft provides a solution to these problems. Windows 3.0
includes a new version of EMM386.SYS (the MS-DOS EMS emulator for the 80386
processor) that cooperates with enhanced Windows.

If this EMS emulator is installed in the system and is being used when
enhanced Windows is started, enhanced Windows extracts information about its
current handles and continues to support these while it is running. EMM386
is turned off during this period. When enhanced Windows exits, it turns
EMM386 back on.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Note

There are certain restrictions that apply to any global software that will
make use of this feature. These restrictions are documented in the Windows
Global EMM Import Specification, which may be obtained by requesting it from
Microsoft OnLine.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The following table and explanatory notes describe the ways in which Windows
reacts to other expanded memory managers:

  1.  Windows will print an error message and abort.

  2.  Enhanced Windows will bypass and ignore an installed physical EMS
      board that has no open handles. Enhanced Windows will then provide
      simulated expanded memory to Windows applications and non-Windows
      applications. When enhanced Windows exits, the physical EMS will once
      again be available.

  3.  Standard Windows will ignore the installed physical EMS, which will
      continue to function and may be used by Windows applications and
      non-Windows applications. There is no break in continuity across
      standard Windows execution, so memory-resident applications can
      continue uninterrupted.

  4.  Enhanced Windows can turn off certain expanded memory emulators
      (including Microsoft EMM386 4.0 and Compaq CEMM), provided they have
      no open handles. Enhanced Windows will then provide simulated EMS to
      Windows applications and non-Windows applications. The EMS emulator
      will be reenabled when enhanced Windows exits.

  5.  Standard Windows can turn off certain expanded memory emulators
      (including all the versions of Microsoft EMM386 and Compaq CEMM),
      provided they have no open handles. There will be no EMS available
      while standard Windows is running. The EMS emulator will be reenabled
      when standard Windows exits.

  6.  Enhanced Windows will take over any open handles and disable the
      emulator until enhanced Windows exits. As noted above, EMS-using
      software must obey certain guidelines in this configuration.



6.3.3  The Problem of Asynchronous Events

Handling asynchronous events is a problem in all multitasking situations.
The problem occurs when network software does not realize that it is being
called by several different applications. It tries to communicate with an
application that has moved or been replaced, and the system usually crashes.


Figures 6.3 and 6.4 show a typical scenario in which enhanced Windows,
MS-DOS, MS-DOS device drivers, and the network TSR are all loaded before
enhanced Windows and are, therefore, shared between all the virtual
machines. While the two applications are running concurrently in separate
virtual machines, the following happens:


  1.  App2 makes an asynchronous network call, passing in the addresses of a
      buffer and a callback function.

  2.  The network software stores the addresses, sends off the asynchronous
      request to the network, and immediately returns to the caller.

  3.  Time passes, and enhanced Windows gives control to App3.

  4.  The network sends back the requested information. The network software
      gets control (either through the network card generating an interrupt
      or by polling on a timer interrupt) and reads the information.

  5.  The network software copies the information to the buffer address that
      it stored. However, in the current VM's context, this address does not
      point to App2's buffer but to the middle of App3's code. If App3 were
      to run after this, it would probably crash.

  6.  The network software calls the procedure address that it stored
      earlier. In VM2 this was App2's post routine, but in VM3 it is a
      random piece of App3's data.

  7.  As a result, random things happen.

      (This figure may be found in the printed book).

      (This figure may be found in the printed book).


As indicated earlier, this is not a problem unique to enhanced Windows. It
is also true in real-mode Windows with EMS, as well as other applications
that bank code or data in expanded memory, and even normal applications that
use overlays. In each case, the environment or the application has to make a
special effort to work with the moving targets.

When is this not a problem? If the application is using standard NetBIOS
calls, Windows will take care of it automatically. If the application is
doing only synchronous network operations, and those operations occur
entirely in a critical section (such as an MS-DOS call), you are safe since
neither mode of Windows will switch contexts until the operation has
completed. This means that no work is usually required to support an
application accessing a redirected drive.

The problem is less severe under standard or real-mode Windows, since it
does not multitask non-Windows applications. In this case, the user must
explicitly choose to switch tasks. However, in enhanced Windows, tasks are
constantly being switched without the user's knowledge.

The following subsections discuss various solutions to problems resulting
from asynchronous calls.


Modifying the Network Software to be Enhanced-Windows Aware

The first solution is relatively easy. It requires changes to the network
software, but no customizing of enhanced Windows.

Every time the network saves an application's buffer or callback address, it
must ask enhanced Windows for the current virtual machine's ID number (VM
ID) and save that with the addresses. Later, when it needs to access these
locations, it can again ask for the current VM ID. If the two numbers are
not the same, then the network software knows its stored addresses are
invalid for this VM.

This solution worked fine under enhanced Windows 2.x. The network could get
the current VM's ID using an INT 2FH call. If it found itself in the wrong
context, it could simply go back to sleep and try again at the next timer
interrupt, repeating the process until it happened to occur in the right
virtual machine.

Version 3.0 provides the same solution, but with an improvement. When the
network wakes up in the wrong virtual machine, it can tell enhanced Windows
to schedule a callback for itself the next time the proper VM is run. This
way it does not have to keep waking up unnecessarily with every timer tick.
(See Appendix D, "Windows INT 2FH API," for more information.)

This method still leaves the possibility of overrunning the network's buffer
if too many packets come in before enhanced Windows is able to schedule a
switch to the target VM. However, overrun problems can happen occasionally
even in real mode, and so the software should be able to handle it
correctly.


Creating A Virtual Device

With enhanced Windows version 3.0, it is possible to write a virtual device
that understands the network well enough to route events to their proper
virtual machines.

For example, when the network card generates an interrupt telling the
network software that its information packet has arrived, the virtual device
could read in the information and determine which VM it was supposed to
reach. If that VM is running right then, the virtual device can immediately
simulate the interrupt down into virtual mode and pass the information off
to the network software. Otherwise, it can schedule an event for the target
VM, including boosting its priority to get it to run as soon as possible,
and, at that time, simulate the interrupt.

Using this method, the network software never has to see an interrupt in the
wrong context. Thus, the network software should not need to be modified at
all.

In enhanced mode, this method is used to support standard NetBIOS calls. The
VNETBIOS virtual device maps all arguments to asynchronous calls into a
global buffer located between 640K and 1 megabyte. Thus, the network can
always place the return values into a buffer. Then, later on the VNETBIOS
can copy the data to the application's original buffer. Similarly, VNETBIOS
will set up a dummy callback address to learn when the network request has
been completed and will later call the application's callback address when
convenient.

In addition, the enhanced Windows NetBIOS device provides the following
support:


  ■   When a VM terminates, enhanced Windows will cancel any outstanding
      asynchronous network requests it had and cancel all its local
      connections.

  ■   When Windows exits, enhanced Windows will cancel any outstanding
      asynchronous network requests it had and cancel all its local
      connections.


Notice also that the virtual device could take on some part of the network
functionality, thus bypassing the normal network software in some or all
cases. This would avoid the bottleneck of having to call the normal network
software in virtual mode; the virtual device could copy the data directly to
the target application's buffers, and so forth. This would also avoid
data-overrun problems when enhanced Windows is unable to switch to the
proper virtual machine in a reasonable amount of time since a virtual device
can access any VM's address space at any time even when the VM is inactive.
And, finally, it could free up memory for non-Windows applications by, in
effect, moving the entire network into protected mode.


Treating Asynchronous Calls as Critical Sections

A filter or the network software could declare a critical section around the
entire duration of an asynchronous call. This should be done by using the
Windows in 386 enhanced mode INT 2FH call. It would start the critical
section when it would first sent the request over the wire and end it only
when the response came back. During that time, Windows would not be able to
switch tasks, so the return event would always occur in the proper
application's context.

The problem with this is that some asynchronous requests can be outstanding
for a very long time. It is common for a network or an application to keep
an asynchronous read always outstanding, to make sure that it never loses
any data coming in. Of course, this would never allow Windows to switch
away; the user would usually have to exit the application to reach other
tasks.

If this method were only being used by a specific application, it might be
worth it for the user to run it exclusively like this. If it were being done
constantly by the network software, it would be unusable.

In standard or real mode, Windows automatically prevents the user from
switching away from an application that uses acynchronous NetBIOS calls.
Since these modes do not support background execution involving non-Windows
applications, this solution is more acceptable than it would be in 386
enhanced mode.


Advising Against Switching Away

In this scenario, you do not modify enhanced Windows or the network. You
simply tell the user that all the applications that use asynchronous network
requests must be run in exclusive mode (with multitasking disabled), and the
user must not switch away manually while the application is active.

This achieves basically the same results as the previous example, except
that it requires no code changes and allows the user to accidentally crash
their system if they carelessly disobey the advice.


Configuring the PIF File to Prevent Switching

By setting the appropriate bits in the application's PIF file, you can
prevent Windows from ever switching away when the application is running.
This is not the most convenient way to use the application, but it does
prevent the user from switching away while asynchronous events are
outstanding.

The main weakness is that the user may not have proper PIF files for all
their network applications.

The Microsoft Windows User's Guide contains more information on configuring
PIF options.


6.3.4  The Problem of Protected Mode API

This is a problem with Windows 3.0, but only for Windows applications that
call non-Windows APIs.

When Windows 3.0 is running in standard or 386 enhanced mode, Windows
applications run in protected mode, while MS-DOS, the BIOS, and all
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs (such as networks) run in virtual
mode. The former use selector:offset addresses, the latter use
segment:offset addresses. Not only are the two addressing modes
incompatible, but the segment:offset addresses cannot reference
protected-mode memory. This presents problems when a protected-mode
application (e.g., any Windows application) needs to pass an address to
MS-DOS, the BIOS, the network, or any other software loaded before Windows.
The problem can occur as follows:


  1.  The Windows application places the address of its buffer into a pair
      of registers or on the stack. They are in the form of a
      selector:offset pair, pointing to some data in the application's data
      segment.

  2.  The application executes an interrupt to talk to the network.

  3.  Enhanced Windows or the DOS Extender reflects the interrupt down into
      virtual mode, so that the network software (which cannot run in
      protected mode) can handle it.

  4.  The network extracts the selector:offset pair passed in and
      misinterprets it as a segment:offset address.

  5.  The network reads from or writes to a random piece of conventional
      memory, causing unpredictable but usually fatal results.


In practice, the process may vary slightly, but it usually ends with memory
being trashed.

The solution is to intelligently translate the application's selector:offset
into a valid segment:offset before handing the address off to the network
software. This is often referred to as "mapping" the API between modes. The
mapper must hook the interrupt in question and determine the exact API being
used. In every case where an address is being passed, the mapper must copy
the passed data or buffer space down into virtual-mode memory, replace the
selector:offset register values with a segment:offset pair pointing to the
data's new location, and, finally, simulate the original interrupt to let
the recipient software handle it. (See Figure 6.5 for an illustration of
this process.)

When the network software returns from the interrupt, the API mapper must go
through the same process but in reverse, copying data from the real-mode
address to a protected-mode location, and readjusting the pointer to a
selector: offset again so that the original caller can use it correctly.

(This figure may be found in the printed book).

If the API involves passing buffers that contain segment addresses, the API
mapper must also translate all of these, as well as copy the data they point
to into V86 address space.

Notice that this is not usually a problem. Windows already takes care of
translating the following most commonly used APIs:


  ■   Standard MS-DOS calls (including network-related MS-DOS functions)

  ■   Standard BIOS calls

  ■   Standard NetBIOS calls


In addition, no work is required in the following cases:


  ■   An application doing I/O directly to the hardware.

  ■   An API going only between applications running in protected mode.

  ■   An API going only between software running in real mode.

  ■   An API that does not involve passing addresses or any data in segment
      registers or on the stack.


Usually, it is a problem only when a protected-mode Windows application
needs to pass addresses to a real-mode TSR or device driver, using an API
that Windows does not understand. Unfortunately, many networks fit all these
requirements.

The following subsections describe several ways to implement API mapping.


Enhanced Windows Virtual Devices

In enhanced Windows, a virtual device can be written to handle API mapping.
This is the standard method used for all APIs supported by the packaged
product.

When the API is relatively simple, the enhanced Windows code to do the
mapping can be almost entirely table driven, requiring only simple
modifications to the basic examples provided with this kit.

The main disadvantage of this method is that separate code needs to be
written specifically for the 386 enhanced mode environment.


The DPMI Translation Services

Both standard and 386 enhanced mode Windows support the DOS Protected Mode
Interface (DPMI). This is a set of services available to protected-mode
applications via INT 31H, that allows them to do their own API mapping.
These DPMI calls include services for LDT selector-management, DOS
memory-management, interrupts, and translations. They can allow a single
piece of code to map an API under either the real, standard, or enhanced
modes of Windows 3.0. Therefore, this is the recommended method for adding
such support. (For a copy of the DPMI specification, you can submit a
service request via Microsoft OnLine.)

These services do not provide intelligence; they only provide the mechanical
means for such activities as copying to and from real mode and hooking
real-mode interrupts or callback addresses. It is still the responsibility
of the application to analyze the arguments being passed and translate them
one by one between protected and real modes.

So who will actually call the translation services? They have to be called
by code running in protected mode, and that means Windows code. It can be
done in several ways:


  ■   A dynamic-link library (DLL) could be written that traps all network
      interrupts generated in protected mode. It would then use DPMI
      services to map the arguments down into real mode and simulate the
      interrupt for the real-mode software to handle. This method has the
      advantage of supporting existing applications that use interrupt-based
      APIs.

  ■   A similar DLL could be written but, instead of trapping interrupts, it
      could provide the appropriate high-level network API to Windows
      applications. The DLL would look at the current mode: if operating in
      real mode, it would simply call the standard network interrupts, but
      if running in protected mode, it would use DPMI. This method is more
      efficient than the preceding one because it avoids the considerable
      overhead of generating and trapping interrupts.

  ■   A combination DLL could provide both a high-level procedural API for
      newer applications and transparent interrupt-mapping services for
      existing applications.


Once the DLL is written, it can be installed in various ways:


  ■   The code can be built into the Windows network driver.

  ■   The code can reside in a standalone DLL, which is installed by listing
      it on the WIN.INI file's LOAD= line. This would have no user
      interface.

  ■   The DLL can be invoked by an application that the user starts manually
      or by using the LOAD= entry in WIN.INI. This application could then
      provide other functions or a user interface as well.

  ■   If the API is going to be called by only a single application, the DLL
      could be distributed as part of the application. We recommend that the
      code remain in a DLL rather than be embedded in the application to
      maintain portability. The DLL can be dynamically linked at load time
      or explicitly when the application is running in protected mode.



A Shortcut for Simple NetBIOS Extensions

The basic Windows installations come with NetBIOS support, because this is
the most common network interface across platforms.

Since many networks add simple extensions to this interface, the standard
NetBIOS device for enhanced Windows and the DOS Extender both support a
special INT 2FH call for communicating with NetBIOS software. The network
(or a simple TSR or device driver) should watch for this interrupt and
respond by passing the address of a table describing the complete API to be
mapped. The mapper can then use this table to handle both standard NetBIOS
and the particular network's extensions.

In cases where the changes would have been trivial, this method will let the
network vendor write a single piece of code and avoid modifying the Windows
NetBIOS mappers. If a TSR is used, this method also has the advantage that
no changes need be made to the real-mode network software.

For further information on the INT 2FH call, see the VNETBIOS source code
included on the DDK disks and Appendix D, "Windows INT 2FH API."


Handling the API Entirely in Protected Mode

As mentioned in Section 6.3.3, "The Problem of Asynchronous Events," a
virtual device could be written that would emulate all the functionality of
the real-mode network software, watching for interrupts from protected or
real mode and talking directly to the network card.

The advantages of this are enormous: not only would it remove the necessity
of copying arguments between real and protected mode, but it could also
allow the user to remove the real-mode software altogether, freeing up space
for non-Windows applications.

However, this is obviously a lot of work; in effect, it means rewriting the
network software for a new platform. It is also not a feasible solution for
Windows in standard mode.


6.3.5  The Problem of Virtualizing Connections

Virtualizing connections is a problem in enhanced Windows (for both versions
2.x and 3.0) and to a lesser extent in other multitasking systems.

When dealing with multiple application contexts but global network software,
we run into problems if the user is able to add and delete network
connections. Some of these are real issues of compatibility and system
integrity, while others are matters of maintaining a reasonable user
interface. For example:


  ■   If App1 is reading files from a network drive and the user goes into
      another virtual machine and deletes the connection to that server,
      what happens to App1?

  ■   If the user changes default directories in one VM, on a network or
      local drive, should this affect other VMs?

  ■   If the user makes a connection in Windows and, then, starts another
      virtual machine, should the connection just made be inherited by the
      second VM?

  ■   If the user makes a connection in one task and, then, exits that task
      without deleting the connection, the network may not be able to clean
      up its data structures. This can leave us with an "orphan" connection
      that can never be accessed or deleted. If you accumulate too many
      orphan connections, the network becomes clogged and useless.


In a perfect world, Windows should either maintain completely separate
virtual machines, each with its own set of network connections, or keep a
single global state. However, in most cases, a balance between the two needs
to be maintained. For example, problems might occur if one application could
change another's current directory.

The network support provided by Microsoft, both for MS-Network and LanMan,
maintains global network connections. Real and standard mode Windows simply
save and restore the correct drive:directory context whenever it switches
between applications. 386 enhanced mode Windows maintains a complete set of
current drive:directory information for each VM.

Network support written for other networks may keep global connections or
provide for separate connections in each VM, as appropriate. If the later
course is chosen, a mechanism to allow inheritance might also be
implemented, so that each new VM inherits the current connection in Windows
at that time.

Some networks may choose to handle the virtualization themselves rather than
rely on a virtual device. By keeping track of the current virtual machine
ID, the network can maintain a separate state for each VM and manage these
however it sees fit.

This can also be improved by providing an enhanced Windows virtual device
that can inform the network software when virtual machines are created and
destroyed. The virtual device can even manage instance data within the
network software by transparently inserting the appropriate data for the
current virtual machine context.


6.4  Support and Distribution

Various networks may require one or more of the following:


  ■   A Windows network driver

  ■   One or more enhanced Windows virtual devices

  ■   A modified DOS Extender

  ■   A modified version of the network software

  ■   API-mapping DLLs


Microsoft provides the components necessary to support Microsoft Network and
Microsoft LAN Manager. Most networks that are compatible with these can
continue to use the standard versions.

In addition, sample sources for several Microsoft Network and NetBIOS
components are made available as examples and can be modified when
necessary.

In cases where the network software must be modified, those changes need to
be distributed by the network vendor. If a customer calls Microsoft with
problems, they will be informed of the necessary upgrade and told to contact
their vendor.

Network vendors who develop other components should also make these
components available to their customers. In some cases, though, Microsoft
may be able to distribute these components. See Appendix C, "Creating
Distribution Disks for Drivers," in the Microsoft Windows Virtual Device
Adaptation Guide for more information on how to distribute new drivers.






Chapter 7  Network Drivers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The Microsoft Windows network driver provides the Windows File Manager and
system utilities with a generic network interface. This interface provides a
subset of functions that are generally available across many networks. The
main functions specified in this chapter, and that should be supported in
the driver, include:


  ■   Making and breaking network connections

  ■   Printing over a network connection

  ■   Tracking the progress of print jobs on the network spooler


The Windows File Manager, Control Panel, and Print Manager use these
functions. Therefore, the driver should be fully functional to support each
of these features, if applicable to your network.

In some cases, there will also be a unique network driver for each version
of a particular network product.

The functions exported by a network driver are called via entry points in
the USER module of the Windows core. The driver should export all calls with
their export ordinals. (See Section 7.11, "Function Summary," for a complete
list of the functions and their export ordinals.) It is necessary to have
stub functions for unimplemented functions.

During any of these calls, the driver is allowed to put up a dialog box
asking for or presenting additional information. If this is done, make sure
that the dialog box uses the correct parent window. This can be obtained by
repeatedly calling the GetFocus() and GetParent() functions.

The network driver must export all the functions defined in this chapter,
including the Enable() and Disable() functions. If there is no appropriate
action for a function to take, then it should just return WN_NOT_SUPPORTED.
However, the Enable() and Disable() functions are exceptions and return
nothing.


7.1  Initializing, Enabling, and Disabling

The driver's initialization routine (the dynamic-link library (DLL's) entry
point) should check to make sure that the appropriate network is actually
installed and running. If it is not, the initialization routine should put
up an appropriate error dialog box to inform the user and return a value of
FALSE, which will prevent the driver from being loaded and taking up space
unnecessarily. The system then behaves exactly as if no network driver were
installed.

The driver also has the option of informing the user of the problem by
putting up an appropriate message box. The MS-Network driver supplied by
Microsoft supports a WIN.INI switch to allow these messages to be disabled
for users that run Windows frequently without loading the network. Other
drivers should use this same switch. See the WININI.TXT file in the Windows
directory for more information.

The driver must also implement the Enable() and Disable() functions with the
proper ordinal values of 21H and 22H, respectively. These functions are
called when Windows is enabling or disabling the OEM layer.

Enable() is called when Windows is loading the driver for the first time and
when resuming Windows after it has been suspended. That is, when running in
real or standard mode and returning to Windows after switching away from a
non-Windows application.

Disable() is called before the driver's WEP() function when Windows is
closing down and also when Windows is about to be suspended. That is, when
running in real or standard mode and Windows is about to be suspended to
switch to a non-Windows application.

For example, if a network driver needs to hook an interrupt, it should make
such a hook during the Enable() function and remove it during the Disable()
function. This would prevent the driver's hook routine from being called
when Windows was swapped out to disk.

Notice that these functions do not have the same usage as the similar
functions defined for graphics drivers.

As with all DLLs, the driver must export a WEP() function. This should be
exported by name only, not by ordinal value. It will be called when Windows
is about to remove the driver when closing down. See Chapter 10, "Common
Functions," for more information on this function.


7.2  Passing Buffers

The following calls take the address and size of a buffer into which the
function will place a variable-sized data structure.


  ■   WNetGetConnection()

  ■   WNetGetErrorText()

  ■   WNetGetUser()


In each case, the mechanism used is the same. First, the caller allocates a
buffer. It then passes its address to the function in lpBuffer and the
address of a WORD containing the buffer size in lpBufferSize. The function
then copies as much of the requested data structure as it can into the
buffer.

If it all fits, the function returns successfully. However, if it does not,
the data may be left incomplete, and the function returns the WN_MORE_DATA
status. In both cases, lpBufferSize is filled with the number of bytes
actually required by the data structure. This way, if the buffer passed in
was too small and the function failed, the caller may allocate a new buffer
of the required size and call the function again.

All the data structures used are of a fixed size. They are allocated in a
contiguous array starting at the beginning of the buffer. When they need to
refer to variable-length strings, the data structures will contain pointers
in the form of WORD offsets into the buffer. All strings should be
zero-terminated. The driver should allocate space in the buffer to store
these strings, starting at the end of the buffer and growing downward. When
there is insufficient room in the middle for one more structure and its
attendant strings, the driver stops adding data and returns the WN_MORE_DATA
value.


7.3  Determining Network Capabilities

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetGetCaps(WORD nIndex); Export Ordinal @ 13

This function is used for determining which network calls are supported by
the current driver.

Unlike all the other calls, this function does not return an error status.
Instead, the nIndex parameter specifies a query, and that defines the
possible values returned.

A few of the nIndex values cause a constant to be returned. However, in most
cases, the nIndex parameter specifies which set of services is being
queried, and the return value is a bitmask indicating which services in that
set are supported. A zero value would indicate that none of the services in
that set is supported.

Each value for nIndex is listed below, along with the constants defining the
bits in the returned mask.

  #define WNNC_SPEC_VERSION  0x0001

    The high and low bytes of the return value contain the major and minor
    version numbers of the network driver specification to which the driver
    conforms.

    For this version, it would return 0x0300.

  #define WNNC_NET_TYPE   0x0002

    Returns a WORD value; the high byte contains the network type, and the
    low byte may contain a subtype. The following Net Type values are
    defined:

  #define WNNC_NET_None      0x0000
  #define WNNC_NET_MSNet      0x0100
  #define WNNC_NET_LanMan      0x0200
  #define WNNC_NET_NetWare      0x0300
  #define WNNC_NET_Vines      0x0400
  #define WNNC_NET_10NET      0x0500

    Developers working on new drivers should register their new type and
    subtype values with Microsoft via an OnLine service request.

  #define WNNC_DRIVER_VERSION  0x0003

    Returns the driver version number.

  #define WNNC_USER   0x0004

    Returns a mask of:

  #define WNNC_USR_GetUser      0x0001

  #define WNNC_CONNECTION   0x0006

    Returns a mask of:

  #define WNNC_CON_AddConnection     0x0001
  #define WNNC_CON_CancelConnection    0x0002
  #define WNNC_CON_GetConnections     0x0004
  #define WNNC_CON_AutoConnect     0x0008
  #define WNNC_CON_BrowseDialog     0x0010

    Notice that the WNNC_CON_AutoConnect bit does not represent a network
    driver function. Instead, it means that the network will support the
    standard MS-DOS Open function for automatically connecting to network
    resources.

  #define WNNC_PRINTING   0x0007

    Returns a mask of:

  #define WNNC_PRT_OpenJob      0x0002
  #define WNNC_PRT_CloseJob     0x0004
  #define WNNC_PRT_HoldJob      0x0010
  #define WNNC_PRT_ReleaseJob     0x0020
  #define WNNC_PRT_CancelJob     0x0040
  #define WNNC_PRT_SetJobCopies     0x0080
  #define WNNC_PRT_WatchQueue     0x0100
  #define WNNC_PRT_UnwatchQueue     0x0200
  #define WNNC_PRT_LockQueueData     0x0400
  #define WNNC_PRT_UnlockQueueData     0x0800
  #define WNNC_PRT_ChangeMsg     0x1000
  #define WNNC_PRT_AbortJob     0x2000

    Notice that the WNNC_PRT_ChangeMsg bit does not represent a network
    driver function, but rather means that the driver will send
    SP_QUEUECHANGED messages to Print Manager. See Section 7.8.1, "Watching
    a Network Print Queue," for details.

  #define WNNC_DEVICEMODE    0x0008

    Returns a mask of:

  #define WNNC_DEVM_DeviceMode     0x0001

  #define WNNC_ERROR   0x000A

    Returns a mask of:

  #define WNNC_ERR_GetError     0x0001
  #define WNNC_ERR_GetErrorInfo     0x0002


7.4  Displaying the Driver-Specific Dialog Box

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetDeviceMode(HWND hParent); Export Ordinal @ 14

As with printer drivers, the network software may have many options that
cannot be predicted or incorporated into a generic interface. Therefore, we
provide a method for bringing up a dialog box that is provided by the
network driver and is tailored to the specific network's needs. (See the
Systems Application Architecture, Common User Access: Advanced Interface
Design Guide for a description of the style to which the user interface
should conform.)

This dialog box is the proper place for the authors to display information
such as the driver's name, version numbers of both the driver and the
installed network software, and copyright notice. If the driver wants to
provide online help, that functionality can also be accessed through this
dialog box.

This is also the place from which the user can access functionality that is
specific to the network. For example, if the network supports sending
messages to another user, the driver can supply an interface in its
device-mode dialog box. The user will be able to invoke this dialog box from
the Windows Control Panel.

The hParent parameter specifies the handle to a window that should be used
as the dialog box's parent.

The following are the normal return values for this function:

╓┌───────────────────────────┌───────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Return Value                Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WN_SUCCESS                  Success
WN_NOT_SUPPORTED            Function not supported
WN_OUT_OF_MEMORY            Out of memory
WN_NET_ERROR                Network error
WN_WINDOWS_ERROR            Windows function failed
WN_BAD_VALUE                Invalid nType value
WN_BAD_POINTER              Invalid pointer



7.5  Displaying the Browse Dialog Box

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetBrowseDialog(HWND hParent, WORD nType, LPSTR szPath);
Export Ordinal @ 15

This function displays one or more dialog boxes that enable the user to
select a network resource. The nType parameter specifies what kind of
resource you are looking for; possible values include WNBD_CONN_DISKTREE and
WNBD_CONN_PRINTQ. The szPath string is used to pass back the network path of
the selected resource. The hParent parameter is the handle to a window that
should be specified as the parent of the new dialog box.

The function returns a string containing the complete network path selected.
It should be formatted so that it can be passed unaltered to
WNetAddConnection().

If the caller allocates a buffer that is too small to hold the path, it
cannot call again because that would cause the driver to prompt the user a
second time. Therefore, the caller will allocate a buffer of at least 128
characters in length.

The following are the normal return values for this function:

╓┌──────────────────────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Return Value               Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Return Value               Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WN_SUCCESS                 Success
WN_NOT_SUPPORTED           Function not supported
WN_OUT_OF_MEMORY           Out of memory
WN_NET_ERROR               Network error
WN_WINDOWS_ERROR           Windows function failed
WN_BAD_VALUE               Invalid nType value
WN_CANCELLED               Cancelled at user's request
WN_BAD_POINTER             Invalid pointer



7.6  Getting the Current Username

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetGetUser(LPSTR szUser, WORD FAR *  nBufferSize); Export
Ordinal @ 16

This function places the current username into the szUser string. It uses
the standard mechanism of receiving and returning the buffer size required
in the nBufferSize parameter. (See Section 7.2, "Passing Buffers," for more
detailed information.) If the network does not support a string that
directly corresponds to the MS-NET username, the driver can either return an
acceptable substitute or not support this function.

The following are the normal return values for this function:

╓┌───────────────────────┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Return Value            Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WN_SUCCESS              Success
WN_NOT_SUPPORTED        Function not supported
WN_OUT_OF_MEMORY        Out of memory
WN_NET_ERROR            Network error
WN_BAD_POINTER          Invalid pointer
WN_BAD_USER             Not logged in; no current username
WN_MORE_DATA            The buffer was too small



7.7  Device Redirecting Functions

These are calls that redirect standard MS-DOS devices, such as drive letters
and LPT ports, so that standard applications may use them and access the
network in a totally transparent manner.


7.7.1  Adding Network Connections

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetAddConnection(LPSTR szNetPath, LPSTR  szPassword, LPSTR
szLocalName); Export Ordinal @ 17

This function redirects a local device (either a disk drive or a printer
port) to a shared device on a remote server.

All szLocalName strings (such as "LPT1") are case independent. The following
are the only names used:

  "A:"  -  "Z:"
  "LPT1"  -  "LPT3"

The following are the normal return values for this function:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────╖
Return Value                      Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WN_SUCCESS                        Success

WN_NOT_SUPPORTED                  Function not supported

WN_OUT_OF_MEMORY                  Out of memory

WN_NET_ERROR                      Network error

WN_BAD_POINTER                    Invalid pointer

WN_BAD_NETNAME                    Invalid network resource name

WN_BAD_LOCALNAME                  Invalid local device name

WN_BAD_PASSWORD                   Invalid password

WN_ACCESS_DENIED                  Security violation

Return Value                      Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

WN_ALREADY_CONNECTED              Local device already connected to a
                                  remote resource




7.7.2  Removing Network Connections

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetCancelConnection(LPSTR szName, BOOL  fForce); Export
Ordinal @ 18

This function cancels a redirection. The szName string either specifies the
name of the redirected local device (such as "LPT1") or a fully-qualified
network path. If a network path is specified, the driver will cancel all the
connections to that resource.

The fForce parameter indicates whether or not any open files or open print
jobs on the device should be closed before the connection is cancelled. If
fForce is FALSE and there are open files or jobs, the connection should not
be cancelled and the function should  return the WN_OPEN_FILES error value.


The following are the normal return values for this function:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Return Value                      Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WN_SUCCESS                        Success

WN_NOT_SUPPORTED                  Function not supported

WN_OUT_OF_MEMORY                  Out of memory

WN_NET_ERROR                      Network error

WN_BAD_POINTER                    Invalid pointer

WN_BAD_VALUE                      szName is not a valid local device or
                                  network name
Return Value                      Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  network name

WN_NOT_CONNECTED                  szName is not a redirected local device or
                                  currently accessed network resource

WN_OPEN_FILES                     Files are open and fForce was FALSE.
                                  Connection was not cancelled.




7.7.3  Listing Network Connections

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetGetConnection(LPSTR szLocalName, LPSTR lpRemoteName,
WORD FAR * nBufferSize); Export Ordinal @ 12

This function returns the name of the network resource associated with a
redirected local device.

The szLocalName string specifies the name of the redirected local device.
The name of the remote network resource is returned in the lpRemoteName
parameter.

This function uses the standard mechanism of taking the maximum length of
lpRemoteName in nBufferSize and returning the actual required length in the
same location. (See Section 7.2, "Passing Buffers," for more detailed
information.)

The following are the normal return values for this function:

╓┌────────────────────┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Return Value         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WN_SUCCESS           Success
WN_NOT_SUPPORTED     Function not supported
WN_OUT_OF_MEMORY     Out of memory
WN_NET_ERROR         Network error
WN_BAD_POINTER       Invalid pointer
WN_BAD_VALUE         szLocalName is not a valid local device
WN_NOT_CONNECTED     szLocalName is not a redirected local device
Return Value         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WN_NOT_CONNECTED     szLocalName is not a redirected local device
WN_MORE_DATA         Buffer was too small



7.8  Net Printing Functions

These are calls for printing over the network as well as for tracking
network print jobs.

The driver may assume that it will only be called by Print Manager. To get
maximum support from Print Manager, you should implement all the functions
that your network software can handle.


7.8.1  Watching a Network Print Queue

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetWatchQueue(HWND hWnd, LPSTR szLocal, LPSTR szUser, WORD
nQueue); Export Ordinal @ 8

This function instructs the driver that Print Manager is interested in the
specified remote queue.

The hWnd parameter is the handle to a window that should be notified when
the status of a job in the queue changes. See Section 7.8.5, "Notification
of Queue Status Changes," for details.

The szLocal string specifies the name of a local device (such as "LPT1")
that has been redirected to a network print queue.

The caller may also specify an szUser string that says that it is only
concerned with jobs belonging to a particular user, and that the driver
should, if possible, only notify Print Manager of changes involving jobs
that belong to that username. This parameter is advisory.

Print Manager will watch each redirected device appearing in the Print
Manager client area (i.e., any active printer ports specified in Control
Panel).

The caller may specify an nQueue value, which is an arbitrary WORD. When the
queue-change notification occurs, the network driver will pass the nQueue
WORD specified for this queue as the wParam value. This will allow Print
Manager to determine which queue to refresh.

The following are the normal return values for this function:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Return Value                      Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

7.8.2  Stop Watching a Network Print Queue

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetUnwatchQueue(LPSTR szLocal); Export Ordinal @ 9

This function informs the driver that Print Manager is no longer interested
in a queue.

The szLocal string specifies the name of a local device that Print Manager
no longer wants to watch.

The driver may assume that watched queues will be cancelled before Print
Manager terminates.

The following are the normal return values for this function:

7.8.3  Locking Network Queue Data

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetLockQueueData(LPSTR szQueue, LPSTR  szUser,
LPQUEUESTRUCT FAR * lplpQueueStruct); Export Ordinal @ 10

Print Manager uses this function to lock a buffer, maintained by the driver,
that describes the state of the queue. (The structure can be created at this
time if it was not already available.)

The szQueue string is the name of a local or remote queue.

The driver places a FAR pointer to a QUEUESTRUCT at the location pointed to
by the lplpQueueStruct parameter. The buffer will contain a single
QUEUESTRUCT followed by zero or more JOBSTRUCTs and the variable-length
strings to which they refer. The number of JOBSTRUCT structures is specified
by the pqJobCount field in QUEUESTRUCT. The strings referenced by JOBSTRUCT
and QUEUESTRUCT are stored by the mechanism described in Section 7.2,
"Passing Buffers." For example, assuming that lpQS is the LPQUEUESTRUCT
returned by WNetLockQueueData(), the expression

  (LPSTR) lpQS + lpQS -&gt;pqComment

is a FAR pointer to the queue comment. All offsets are relative to the
beginning of the buffer, not the beginning of an individual JOBSTRUCT.

If the szUser string is not NULL, it indicates that Print Manager is only
interested in jobs belonging to that user. However, it is advisory, and
Print Manager will not assume that QUEUESTRUCT will only contain information
on those jobs.

While Print Manager's lock is in effect, the queue data must not be modified
or moved. Each lock operation is completed by a matching unlock operation,
as described in the following section.

Notice that if the queue status is WNPRQ_PROBLEM, which means that all the
printers on this queue have stopped, examining the job status for the first
job in the queue will usually reveal the exact nature of the problem.
However, this may not be true if the queue is serviced by multiple printers
that could have different problems, or if the first job is paused and the
first non-paused job is being held up by an error.

7.8.4  Unlocking Network Queue Data

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetUnlockQueueData(LPSTR szQueue); Export Ordinal @ 11

This function informs the driver that Print Manager is no longer examining a
block of queue data. The driver is free to deallocate, reallocate, move, or
modify the queue information at this point.

The szQueue string is the name of a network printer queue and is either a
redirected local name or a remote name. This device should have been
previously specified in a call to WNetWatchQueue().

The following are the normal return values for this function:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►

Return Value                      Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────




7.8.5  Notification of Queue Status Changes

A driver indicates that it can support notification by setting the
WNNC_PRT_ChangeMsg bit returned by WNetGetCaps(). See Section 7.3,
"Determining Network Capabilities," for more detailed information.

When Print Manager is watching a queue, the driver is free to notify it of
queue changes by posting SP_QUEUECHANGED messages to the window handle
specified by the hWnd parameter on the WNetWatchQueue() call. The driver
must use the PostMessage() function and not the SendMessage() function. The
wParam parameter should contain the value passed by Print Manager in its
call to WNetWatchQueue(). The lParam parameter should be NULL.

The driver should, if possible, only send messages relating to the queue
that was specified in lpszLocal, and only when jobs belonging to the current
username change status. However, the message is purely advisory; the driver
should not assume that a Lock/Unlock pair will result from the posting of
this message, or that Print Manager will only lock a queue in response to
one of these messages. Conversely, Print Manager does not assume that any
job has actually changed status simply because this message was received.

As you can see, polling is easy to support with this mechanism; all that is
required is for the driver to post the SP_QUEUECHANGED messages
periodically.

The following is the queue-changed message:

  #define SP_QUEUECHANGED  0x0500 /* advises Print Manager that  */
      /* a queue has changed         */


7.8.6  Opening a Network Print Job

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetOpenJob(LPSTR szQueue, LPSTR szJobTitle, WORD nCopies,
WORD FAR * pfh); Export Ordinal @ 1

This function initializes a print job for transmission across the net. It
returns a file handle in the buffer indicated by the pfh parameter, which
Print Manager can use to write to the spoolfile.

The szQueue string may specify either a redirected local device or a fully
qualified network name of a print queue.

If the szJobTitle string is omitted, the driver may use any appropriate
default.

On some networks, open print jobs will automatically be closed and printed
after some timeout period. It is the responsibility of the driver to make
sure that the network does not timeout on open print jobs, even if the
application is inactive for long periods of time.

The following are the normal return values for this function:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►

7.8.7  Closing a Network Print Job

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetCloseJob(WORD fh, WORD FAR * pidJob, LPSTR szQueue);
Export Ordinal @ 2

This function finishes the processing of a spooled print job. It returns a
unique Job ID in the buffer indicated by the pidJob parameter, and the
normalized name of the network queue in the szQueue string. Together, these
can be used to reference the job at any later time.

If the driver cannot return the correct Job ID, it should return the
constant value of WN_NULL_JOBID, as shown below:

  #define WN_NULL_JOBID 0x0000 /* Job ID not available */

The following are the normal return values for this function:

7.8.8  Putting a Print Job on Hold

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetHoldJob(LPSTR szQueue, WORD wJobID); Export Ordinal @ 4

This function attempts to hold a previously spooled network job.

The exact effect this has will depend upon the network. In most cases, the
held job will continue to move up in the queue until it is ready to print.
However, it will then not be allowed to print and will sit with the queue
number of 1, while other jobs move around it and are printed. This will last
until the job is released using the WNetReleaseJob() function.

The following are the normal return values for this function:

7.9  Extended Error Functions

These functions are designed to get more detailed information about
network-dependent errors.


7.9.1  Getting the Current Network Error

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetGetError(WORD FAR * nError) Export Ordinal @ 19

This function returns the network status code from the last network
operation.

Notice that this is guaranteed to be correct only if the application calls
immediately after receiving the network driver error status. If another
application is given a chance to run, it may call the driver and the
original extended error condition would be overwritten.

The following are the normal return values for this function:

╓┌──────────────────────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Return Value               Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WN_SUCCESS                 Success

WN_BAD_POINTER             Invalid pointer
WN_NO_ERROR                No error status available



7.9.2  Getting Extended Error Information

WORD FAR PASCAL WNetGetErrorText(WORD nError, LPSTR  lpBuffer, WORD FAR *
nBufferSize) Export Ordinal @ 20

This function returns a text description associated with a network error
code. This is

called with the nError parameter containing a network error code (as
returned by WNetGetError()). All the parameters are handled as described in
Section 7.2, "Passing Buffers."

The following are the normal return values for this function:

╓┌─────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Return Value      Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

WN_MORE_DATA      The buffer was too small
WN_NO_ERROR       No error status available
WN_BAD_POINTER    Invalid pointer



7.10  Return Values

Most network driver functions return zero if successful and unique non-zero
values for various error conditions.

Currently, there is one exception: WNetGetCaps(), which returns a mask of
bits.

The following is a list of the normal return values:

7.11  Function Summary

The following is a complete alphabetical list of the network driver
functions and their export ordinals. Notice that if the driver exports
functions that are not on this list, then those functions should have export
ordinals greater than 500H. The numbers below 500 are reserved for functions
with prescribed ordinal values. For example, the WNetDeviceMode() dialog box
callback function should have an ordinal value above 500H so as not to
conflict with any required ordinals defined in future versions.

Chapter 8  Keyboard Drivers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Among the disks provided with your Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit,
you will find ones containing source code for the Microsoft Windows 3.0
keyboard driver. We recommend that you use our driver either in its entirety
or with any necessary customizing rather than try to write your own. Section
8.9, "Checklist for Modifying a 3.0 Keyboard Driver," provides steps for you
to follow after reviewing the information provided in this chapter.

When Windows is running, the Windows keyboard driver entirely replaces the
MS-DOS keyboard driver. It is designed, as much as possible, to provide a
hardware-independent interface between the MS-DOS keyboard driver and
Windows. This was done to allow the Windows code that deals with user
interaction (e.g., menus and dialogs) to be as hardware-independent as
possible.

The Windows keyboard driver contains two major functions: the hardware
interrupt function and the ToAscii() function. The first translates hardware
scan codes to Windows virtual key codes, which are passed to Windows for
action and queuing (as keyboard events), and the second is called to
translate the virtual keycodes in the queue (along with the current state of
shift-lock, etc.) to ANSI characters.

For Windows 3.0, the keyboard driver has been split into two modules, the
driver and a library of keyboard tables. The basic driver is somewhat
hardware-specific and contains translation tables only for the US enhanced
keyboard. Tables for other keyboards (i.e., for other countries and other
physical keyboards) are contained in an optional dynamic-link library (DLL),
which is copied by Setup or another application such as Control Panel to the
Windows directory.

Manufacturers should put hardware-specific code into their own version of
the keyboard driver and avoid changing the DLLs, unless their keyboard
layout differs from an IBM-compatible system.

The following sections provide a description of the driver's sample source
code.


8.1  Initialization Code

Initialization code is code that is executed only when the keyboard driver
is first loaded. This code is used mainly for identifying the hardware type.


The code will set a special flag if Windows is running in the OS/2
compatibility box. This flag is used to determine whether or not certain
keys (the SYSRQ key for SYMDEB and screen switching) need to be handled in a
special manner for OS/2.


8.2  Keyboard Entries: Exported Functions

Once Windows finishes loading everything, it then calls the following
exported functions. (See Section 8.10, "Function Reference," for
descriptions of these functions.)


  ■   AnsiToOem()

  ■   AnsiToOemBuff()

  ■   Disable()

  ■   Enable()

  ■   EnableKBSysReq()

  ■   GetKBCodePage()

  ■   GetKeyboardType()

  ■   Inquire()

  ■   MapVirtualKey()

  ■   OEMKeyScan()

  ■   OemToAnsi()

  ■   OemToAnsiBuff()

  ■   ScreenSwitchEnable()

  ■   SetSpeed()

  ■   ToAscii()

  ■   VkKeyScan()



8.3  Internal Functions

The following functions are used internally by the keyboard driver and the
keyboard DLL. Control Panel is the only application that calls them. (See
Section 8.10, "Function Reference," for descriptions of these functions.)


  ■   GetTableSeg()

  ■   NewTable()



8.4  The Keyboard Interrupt Handler and Event Procedure Call

This function primarily traps the keyboard hardware interrupt (INT 09H on
most systems), reads the hardware scan codes generated by the keyboard, and
translates hardware scan codes to Windows virtual key codes. These virtual
key codes are passed to the Windows USER module by calling the keyboard
event procedure. This address was passed to the keyboard driver in the
Enable() function. (See Section 8.10, "Function Reference," for a
description of the Enable() function.)


8.4.1  Parameter Details

The keyboard event procedure is called with the following parameters:

AH = 0 for down stroke, 80H for up stroke AL = Windows virtual key code BH =
0 if no prefix byte, 1 if E0 prefix byte preceded this scan code  (for
IBM-compatible enhanced keyboard. For more information,   see Section 8.4.2,
"Extended Keyboards."). BL = "Hardware" scan code

Notice that while the hardware scan code (which is OEM-dependent) is passed
to Windows, it is not used internally in Windows. It is subsequently passed
to ToAscii(), which may use it for special purposes. The UP/DOWN bit is
masked off.

This function detects the System Request function (normally CTRL+ALT+PRINT
SCREEN) and generates an NMI interrupt, if SYMDEB appears to be trapping the
NMI interrupt.

Under certain circumstances, control is passed to the MS-DOS keyboard
interrupt handler, which was installed when Windows was started. This is the
case for CTRL+ALT+DELETE (soft reboot) and for the PAUSE key.

In the Windows 3.0 keyboard driver, the PRINTSCREEN key is used for making a
screen snapshot, which is saved in the Windows Clipboard. This is handled in
the interrupt routine by calling the event procedure with VK_SNAPSHOT in AL,
with the value equal to 0 (for full-screen snapshot) or 1 (for
current-window snapshot) in BL.


8.4.2  Extended Keyboards

Some keyboards, such as the IBM enhanced keyboard, have an extra ENTER key
on the numeric keypad, as well as separate keys for such functions as CURSOR
CTRL, INSERT, and DELETE. On the IBM enhanced keyboard, these keys have the
same scan codes as the main ENTER key, certain numeric-pad keys (with NUM
LOCK OFF), etc., but the keyboard sends a special prefix byte to indicate
that these keys are pressed. In this case, the Windows 3.0 keyboard driver
sets bit 0 of BH when calling the keyboard event procedure. If this bit is
set, bit 24 is set in the long parameter of the resulting WM_KEYDOWN,
WM_CHAR, etc., messages.

The following are the keys on the IBM enhanced keyboard for which this
extended bit is set:


  ■   INSERT, HOME, PAGE UP, DELETE, END, PAGE DOWN

  ■   Cursor keys

  ■   Numeric-pad DIVIDE and ENTER keys.


For keyboards that have extended keys with special scan codes instead of
prefixes, we recommend that the scan codes be translated to the IBM scan
codes (to allow Windows to translate these keys properly) and that BH be set
to 1 when the event procedure is called for a second ENTER key or for cursor
keys, etc.


8.4.3  The OS/2 Compatibility Box

If Windows is running in the OS/2 compatibility box, two things are done in
the interrupt routine:


  1.  The CTRL+ALT+SYSREQ handling for SYMDEB and CodeView(R) is disabled.

  2.  The CTRL and ESC combinations are passed on to the OS/2 keyboard
      interrupt handler, so that OS/2 screen switching will work.



8.5  Keyboard Driver Internal Tables

The following subsections deal with various internal structures and tables
used with this driver.


8.5.1  Keyboard State Vector

This is a 256-byte vector, maintained by Windows, that contains an entry for
each possible virtual key code. For each entry, bit 7 is set if the key is
down, and cleared when the key is released. Likewise, bit 0 is toggled each
time a key is pressed if it was not already down (i.e., repeats do not
toggle this bit).

The address of this vector is passed to ToAscii(), so that this function may
examine the current state of the shift keys, CAPS LOCK, etc. It is also
passed to the Enable() function, so that the entries for various shift keys
are synchronized with the shift state bits that MS-DOS maintains at 40H:17H.


Mouse buttons also get translated into their corresponding virtual key codes
(i.e., VK_LBUTTON, VK_RBUTTON, VK_CANCEL, and VK_MBUTTON) in the key state
vector. See Section 8.8, "Windows Virtual Key Codes," for a complete list of
the virtual key codes supported in Windows. This information is also
available in the WINDOWS.H file.


8.5.2  Keyboard Information (KBINFO) Data Structure

The following is the data structure for keyboard information (KBINFO).

  typedef struct tagKBINFO
    {
      BYTE  Begin_First_range;  /* used for KANJI */
      BYTE  End_First_range;  /* used for KANJI */
      BYTE  Begin_Second_range;  /* used for KANJI */
      BYTE  End_Second_range;  /* used for KANJI */
      int   StateSize;   /* size of ToAscii state block*/
    } KBINFO;


8.5.3  Key Translation Tables

The following description is specific to the Microsoft keyboard drivers.
Several of the translation tables are associative tables that map a virtual
key code or a combination of a virtual key code and some other value (e.g.,
shift state) into an ASCII character. All such  tables in these drivers are
assembled using special macros, defined in TRANS.INC, that arrange the
tables so that the first column of the table is a single vector, which may
be searched with a single-string scan instruction.

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
keyTrTab                          This table maps hardware scan codes to
                                  Windows virtual key codes. Some entries in
                                  this table in TABS.ASM may be overlaid
                                  when a keyboard DLL is loaded.

USTransPatch                      This is a copy of part of keyTrTab, which

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
USTransPatch                      This is a copy of part of keyTrTab, which
                                  is used to overlay keyTrTab if an error
                                  occurs while changing keyboard DLLs.



Most of the remaining tables are either in a discardable segment in the
driver (if no DLL is loaded) or in a DLL. If they are in the driver,
functions such as ToAscii() that are using them make sure that the table
segment is loaded by calling GetTableSeg().

The tables in the driver are for the US keyboard. Several of the following
tables are blank for the US keyboard since it has no dead keys or CTRL+ALT
keys.

In the DLL versions of these tables, there is often padding (i.e., zeros) at
the end of a table to allow for overlaying the tables.

The US tables are available in the TAB4.INC file, which is included with the
sample source code. These tables for the US enhanced keyboard are duplicated
in the KBDUS.ASM file.

8.6  Keyboard DLL

The KBDxx.ASM tables file contains data in two segments: the CODE segment,
which is load-on-call and disposable, and the DATA segment, which is fixed.
Data from the CODE segment of the DLL is used to overlay the tables in the
DATA segment of the driver. Data in the DATA segment of the DLL is not
copied; instead, a pointer in the driver is set to the DLL's DATA segment
address.

The initial values in the tables in the DLL's DATA segment are for enhanced
(type 4) keyboards. For other keyboard types, the tables in the DLL's DATA
segment must be patched or overlaid from tables in the CODE segment.

The copying or overlaying is done by the GetKbdTable() DLL function, which
is called from the driver after the driver loads the library. Once
GetKbdTable() is called, the driver accesses the DLL's fixed DATA segment
directly. After initialization, the tables in the CODE segment of the DLL
are no longer used.

A header, containing offsets and sizes of the various tables in the DLL's
DATA segment, is always copied to the driver no matter what type of keyboard
is installed.

Some DLLs contain the function GetKeyString(). This function is called by
the keyboard's GetKeyNameText() function (see the Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit for a description of this function) to obtain key name
strings in the language appropriate to the keyboard. (See Section 8.10,
"Function Reference," for more details on GetKbdTable() and GetKeyString().)



8.7  SYSTEM.INI Keyboard Information

With Windows 3.0, some keyboard information is now set in the SYSTEM.INI
file by the Setup program when Windows is first installed. Some of the
values, though, may be changed by the Windows part of Setup during runtime.
They appear in the following order in the SYSTEM.INI file:

  [keyboard]

  type = 4    ;Enhanced keyboard. This value overrides any
      ;type the keyboard driver can determine. This
      ;number generally defines a keyboard layout and
      ;is passed to the DLL initialization code. If
      ;you want the driver to select this value(IBM-
      ;compatibles), leave this blank. (1 is XT,
      ;3 is AT, 4 is Enhanced)

  subtype = 0   ;Used only for Olivetti/AT&amp;T. Only affects
       ;anything now for one AT&amp;T 6300+ keyboard, [but
      ;may be useful for Hewlett-Packard for
      ;distinguishing Vectra/non-Vectra keyboards.

  keyboard.dll = KBDDA.DLL  ;Keyboard layout (Danish keyboard in this
      ;example). May be omitted if you have a USA
      ;XT (83-key), AT (84-key), or Enhanced
      ;(101-key) keyboard. [This means you no
      ;longer copy the keyboard DLL to KBDDLL.MOD.]

  oemansi.bin = XLATNO.BIN  ;Danish/Norwegian code page translation. This
      ;setting is only for NO/DA, PO, ES, CA code
      ;pages now. Must be blank for code page 437
      ;(normal IBM).
      ;(Note:  Another SYSTEM.INI or WIN.INI setting
      ;must be made to select the corresponding OEM
      ;font for real-mode Windows or Windows/386.)


8.8  Windows Virtual Key Codes

This section describes the Windows virtual key codes that are generated by
the hardware interrupt function in the keyboard driver. The translation of
OEM scan codes to virtual key codes is intended to provide a
hardware-independent interface to Windows.

The virtual key code set consists of 256 byte values in the range 0 to 255.
Most, but not all, of the values used by standard drivers are in the range 0
to 127. There is a loose distinction between "standard" keys, which do not
vary much, and "OEM" keys, which do vary from keyboard to keyboard.

Every OEM keyboard driver must provide the following virtual keys. Shift
keys must be available in the combinations Unshifted, SHIFT, CTRL, and
CTRL+ALT.

Type                       Virtual Key Code  Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────



On most keyboards, the following group of virtual key codes is generated on
the numeric keys only if NUMLOCK is OFF:

╓┌──────────────────────────┌─────────────────┌──────────────────────────────╖
Type                       Virtual Key Code  Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Cursor and editing keys    VK_INSERT
                           VK_DELETE
                           VK_HOME           The PAGE UP key
                           VK_END            The PAGE DOWN key
                           VK_PRIOR
                           VK_NEXT

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────



All the above virtual key codes must be generated for full Windows
functionality.

Keyboards commonly contain various "lock" keys, such as VK_CAPITAL and
VK_NUMLOCK. If a keyboard driver generates ANSI characters on the numeric
key pad using ALT + numeric-pad keys, it must do this translation only if
NUMLOCK is ON. Also, care must be taken (on IBM-compatible keyboards) that
the cursor and editing keys on extended keyboards do not produce this
translation.

If a keyboard has a numeric pad, the numeric keys will frequently be used as
cursorcontrol and editing keys if NUMLOCK is OFF. If NUMLOCK is ON, the
virtual keycodes VK_NUMPAD0..VK_NUMPAD9 are used for the digits. Keyboards
with a DELETE key that also generates the decimal point (period or comma)
use VK_DELETE and VK_DECIMAL to distinguish between the two uses of the key.


Other keys may vary from keyboard to keyboard. The following set of virtual
key codes is generally used for punctuation keys, accented letter keys, and
dead keys in the main section of a keyboard:

  VK_OEM_1 .. VK_OEM_8
  VK_OEM_102
  VK_OEM_PLUS, VK_OEM_MINUS, VK_OEM_COMMA, VK_OEM_PERIOD

Applications that send characters to other Windows applications by sending
WM_KEYDOWN and WM_KEYUP messages are expected to get the appropriate virtual
key codes to send by using the VkKeyScan() function. They must not assume
any fixed translation of the VK_OEM_* keys.

If a keyboard has more than 16 function keys, we recommend you use the
virtual key codes in the range VK_OEM_17..VK_OEM_24.

The mouse button virtual key codes (VK_LBUTTON, VK_RBUTTON, VK_MBUTTON, and
VK_CANCEL) are generated internally by Windows and are never generated by
keyboard or mouse drivers.

Keyboard drivers should not generate VK_EXECUTE or VK_SEPARATER.

The following list includes the virtual key codes that are defined for
Windows. VK_SNAPSHOT is new for Windows 3.0. This information is also in the
VKWIN.INC and VKOEM.INC files in the keyboard driver sources.

8.9  Checklist for Modifying a 3.0 Keyboard Driver

If you already have a Windows 2.x keyboard driver, we recommend that you
follow the steps in this checklist to modify the sample Windows 3.0 keyboard
driver, rather than modify your old Windows 2.x keyboard driver. The result
will be more compatible with Windows 3.0.

Also, you should always use the latest available version of the DDK sources.



  ■   Use IFDEFs for the parts that you modify.

      If you can assemble the driver with your IFDEFs OFF and generate the
      "normal" KBD.DRV driver, then it will be easier to integrate support
      for your hardware into Microsoft's sources in the future.

  ■   Identify or select the keyboard type.

      You should avoid doing any I/O during initialization to determine the
      keyboard type. This should be done in Setup, not in the keyboard
      driver.

      There are three things that are defined in SYSTEM.INI on the basis of
      the keyboard hardware, and read with GetPrivateProfileString() or
      GetPrivateProfileInt() in TABS.ASM:

  ■   The name of the keyboard driver in the "KEYBOARD.DRV =" statement.

  ■   The keyboard type in the "TYPE =" statement.

      This is used to select among several different keyboard layouts for a
      particular country, along with some other attributes. This value is
      also used by the keyboard DLL to determine what patches to make in the
      keyboard translation tables.

  ■   The keyboard subtype in the "SUBTYPE =" statement.

      This may be used to differentiate among keyboards that have the same
      layout (i.e., the same basic translation table) but that may have some
      special attributes. The meaning of the subtype will depend on the
      particular OEM driver.

      The automatic detection of the keyboard type is done mainly for fairly
      generic systems. However, it is possible for a driver developer to
      modify the SETUP.INF file to provide manual selection of a keyboard
      driver (and its type and subtype).

      If you read any data from the ROM BIOS, you must use the special
      segment selector __ROMBIOS, which corresponds to real address 0F0000H.
      See the code in INIT.ASM. For information on other special segment
      selectors, see the SDK Guide to Programming.

  ■   Compare your old interrupt function (i.e., DATACOM.ASM in Windows 2.x
      and TRAP.ASM in Windows 3.0) with the one in the Windows 3.0 sample
      keyboard driver.

      You will find that the basic flow of the Windows 3.0 function is quite
      similar to that of the one in the Windows 2.x keyboard driver. Simply
      make similar modifications in the Windows 3.0 TRAP.ASM. The table
      keyTrTab[] in TABS.ASM is used to translate scan codes to virtual key
      codes. You will see some existing IFDEFs for special keyboards in this
      file.

  ■   Integrate special code for your keyboard in TOASCII.ASM by moving it
      from the Windows 2.x to the Windows 3.0 version of the keyboard
      driver.

      Notice that the Inquire() function (in ENABLE.ASM) tells Windows how
      much space to allocate for ToAscii()'s state vector, which maintains
      state between successive calls to ToAscii().

  ■   Examine the INIT code and the Enable() and Disable() functions for any
      special actions that need to be taken when Windows is loaded, when the
      keyboard driver is enabled, and when the keyboard driver is disabled.

      Notice that the Windows keyboard and mouse drivers are disabled when
      switching from Windows to a full-screen MS-DOS application. The calls
      to the keyboard and mouse Enable() functions are always done in the
      reverse order from the calls to the respective Disable() functions.
      This is done to handle systems in which the keyboard and mouse must
      hook or unhook the same interrupts.

  ■   If the repeat speed of your keyboard cannot be set by software, the
      SetSpeed() function may be omitted (but then the definition of the
      function must be omitted from the .DEF file).



8.10  Function Reference

The following is an alphabetically organized reference section that includes
descriptions of each of the functions listed in this chapter.


AnsiToOem(lpSrc, lpDst)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function translates a string in the ANSI character set to a string in
the OEM character set (which is Code Page 437 for most systems).

╓┌────────────────┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Parameter        Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpSrc            A long pointer to the input ANSI string.
lpDst            A long pointer to the output OEM string.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

lpSrc and lpDst may be the same.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Return Value

It always returns 0xFFFF in AX


Comments

The default translation is for Code Page 437 (the standard USA IBM-PC
character set).

Calling the Enable() function will cause the tables for this translation to
be initialized. If the desired code page is not 437, they will be read from
a file.

Strings longer than 64K may be translated.


AnsiToOemBuff(lpSrc, lpDst, nCount)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function performs the same translations as AnsiToOem(), but is used for
translating fixed-length byte arrays, such as database records, which may
contain NULL bytes.

╓┌─────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Parameter         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpSrc             A long pointer to the input ANSI string.
lpDst             A long pointer to the output OEM string.
nCount            The byte count.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

lpSrc and lpDst may be the same.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Return Value

Undefined


Disable()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function restores the MS-DOS keyboard interrupt vector when exiting
Windows.


Parameters

None


Return Value

None


Comments

The Disable() function restores the keyboard hardware interrupt vector to
the keyboard handler that was installed previously.

Disable() is called when exiting Windows and before starting or switching to
a full-screen MS-DOS application running under real or standard-mode
Windows.

When Disable() is called, the MS-DOS keyboard flags (at 40H:17H in most
IBM-compatible systems) must reflect the state of the SHIFT LOCK, NUMLOCK,
and SCROLL LOCK keys. (Normally, the Windows hardware interrupt function
will handle this.)

The keyboard and mouse Enable() functions are always called in the reverse
order of the keyboard and mouse Disable() functions since some mouse drivers
may hook into the keyboard interrupt.


Enable(eventProc, lpKeyState)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function installs the hardware interrupt for Windows and performs the
necessary initialization of the driver.

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
eventProc                         The address (long) of the keyboard event
                                  procedure in USER. (See Section 8.4, "The
                                  Keyboard Interrupt Handler and Event
                                  Procedure Call," for more information on
                                  this function.)

lpKeyState                        The address (long) of the 256-byte key
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpKeyState                        The address (long) of the 256-byte key
                                  state vector in USER. It is accessed here
                                  primarily to synchronize the entries for
                                  SHIFT LOCK
                                  and NUMLOCK with the current state
                                  maintained by the MS-DOS
                                  keyboard driver.




Return Value

None


Comments

The Enable() function must save the original hardware interrupt address in
static memory. The driver should maintain such things as the shift and
numeric lock state, and the state of indicator lights. Linkage with a
keyboard DLL should be established (if one exists).

Enable() is called once when Windows is started up. It is also called when
returning to Windows from a full-screen application for which the keyboard
was disabled.


EnableKBSysReq(fWord)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function is used for enabling and disabling the CTRL+ALT+SYSREQ trap to
the debugger and/or CodeView (CVW).

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────╖
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
fWord                             01 = Enables INT2
                                  02 = Disables INT2
                                  04 = Enables CVW Break
                                  08 = Disables CVW Break




Return Value

Bit 0 indicates INT 2 enabled.

Bit 1 indicates CVW Break enabled.


Comments

The initial behavior is to swallow CTRL+ALT+SYSREQ. If both INT 2 and CVW
are enabled, then CVW overrides.


GetKBCodePage()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function is used to determine which OEM/ANSI tables are loaded in the
keyboard driver.


Parameters

None


Return Value

A code page (integer). This indicates which OEM/ANSI translation tables are
loaded.


Comments

If the OEMANSI.BIN file is in the Windows directory and the code page is not
437, the file will be read when Windows is booted and will overwrite the CP
437 OEM/ANSI translation tables in the keyboard driver. Common values are as
follows:

╓┌────────────┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Code Page    Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
437          Default (USA, most countries. No OEMANSI.BIN file.)
860          Portugal (OEMANSI.BIN  =  XLATPO.BIN)
863          French Canada (OEMANSI.BIN  =  XLATCA.BIN)
865          Norway/Denmark (OEMANSI.BIN  =  XLATNO.BIN)
850          International code page (OEMANSI.BIN  =  XLAT850.BIN)


If the code page is not 437, then one of the XLAT*.BIN files must be copied
to the SYSTEM directory and the following line placed in the [keyboard]
section of SYSTEM.INI:

    OEMANSI.BIN = XLAT850.BIN

If the code page is 437, the preceding line must be blank or have a blank
argument:

    OEMANSI.BIN =

Each one of these .BIN files contains the following:

╓┌──────────────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(word)             Number of bytes that follow (must be 258)
(word)             Code page number
(256 bytes)        OEM/ANSI translation tables



GetKbdTable(iType, lpKeyTrTab, lpHeader)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────




Return Value

This returns a FAR pointer to this DLL's DATA segment in DX:AX (where AX is
0).


Comments

The tables are patched, and various data are copied to the driver.

This function is in a load-on-call disposable segment, which means its
memory may be reclaimed. The DATA segment is fixed.


GetKeyboardType(wWhich)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function enables an application to determine the type of keyboard that
is attached.

╓┌──────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Parameter  Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
wWhich     Selects whether the basic type or the OEM subtype is returned.



Return Value

If Which = 0, it returns keyboard type (1..6)

 1: IBM PC, XT or compatible (83-key)  2: Olivetti M24 "ICO" (102-key)  3:
IBM AT (84 keys) or similar  4: IBM Enhanced (101 or 102 keys)

If Which = 1, it may return OEM-dependent subtype information, which should
be nonzero.


GetKeyString(int nString,LPSTRlpStringOut)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function is called by the keyboard's GetKeyNameText() function to
obtain key name strings in the language appropriate to the keyboard.

╓┌────────────────┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Parameter        Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
nString          The index to a list of strings.
lpStringOut      The selected string is copied to this address.



Return Value

The size of the string (exclusive of NULL termination) is returned in AX.


Comments

GetKeyNameText() checks for this function in the DLL to obtain the localized
version of the key name.


GetTableSeg()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function is for internal use in the keyboard driver only. It is used
when a DLL does not exist.


Parameters

None


Return Value

Paragraph address of a discardable keyboard table segment.


Comments

This function is called only when a keyboard DLL does not exist. It is used
to load the segment containing the default keyboard translation tables and
return its address.

This function is to be called only within the keyboard driver. It is not
part of the Windows API.


Inquire(lpKBInfo)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function fills in the data structure with information about the
keyboard hardware.

╓┌───────────────┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Parameter       Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpKBInfo        A long pointer to the KBINFO data structure.



Return Value

The number of bytes transferred is returned in AX.


MapVirtualKey(wCode, wMapType)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function is intended to be used by the PIF Editor and Windows to get
information about keyboard mapping.

╓┌──────────────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Parameter          Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
wCode              The input scan code or VK code
wMapType           Selects mapping as follows:
                   wMapType = 0:   Map VK to scan code
                   wMapType = 1:   Map scan code to VK
                   wMapType = 2:   Map VK to ASCII



Return Value

AX = Mapped value

Returns 0 if mapping cannot be performed (scan codes and VK codes are always
&gt; 0).


Comments

For the first two mappings, the scan code to VK code translation table is
examined to determine the translations. Some valid codes may not be
translated in this table.

For the third type of mapping, uppercase letters A..Z are returned for
VK_A..VK_Z. ASCII digits are returned for the top-row numeric keys
VK_0..VK_9. For punctuation and dead keys in the main part of the keyboard,
the unshifted character will be returned.


NewTable()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function determines the keyboard type and tries to load a keyboard DLL.



Parameters

None


Return Value

None


Comments

The following entries in WIN.INI are accessed:

  [keyboard]
  type = 4; 1..6.
  OliType = 0 ; 0 for all but Olivetti systems

Internal keyboard type variables are set. If a keyboard DLL is found and
loaded, its handle is saved; this is subsequently used by the driver to
determine whether to use the tables in the movable TABS segment or the DLL
tables.

This function determines the type of keyboard that is installed by reading
WIN.INI values. If they are not found, the default type is determined by the
type of system for which the particular driver is designed.


OEMKeyScan(wOemChar)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function maps OEM ASCII codes (0..0FFH) into OEM scan codes and shift
states. This function provides information that enables a program to send
OEM text to another program by simulating keyboard input. Windows, when
running in 386 enhanced mode, uses it specifically for this purpose.


Parameters

It is passed the OEM ASCII code as wOemChar.


Return Value

AX = scan code DX = shift state  bit 2 = CTRL + SHIFT depressed  bit 1 =
either SHIFT depressed

If the character is not defined in the tables, -1 is returned in both DX and
AX.


Comments

This function does not provide translations for characters that require CTRL
+ ALT or dead keys. Characters that are not translated by this function must
be copied by simulating ALT + numeric-pad input.

This function calls VkKeyScan() in the Windows 3.0 drivers.


OemToAnsi(lpSrc, lpDst)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function translates a string in the current OEM character set to ANSI.


╓┌─────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Parameter         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpSrc             A long pointer to the input ANSI string.
Parameter         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpSrc             A long pointer to the input ANSI string.
lpDst             A long pointer to the output OEM string.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

lpSrc and lpDst may be the same.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Return Value

It always returns 0xFFFF in AX.


Comments

The default translation is for Code Page 437 (the standard USA IBM-PC
character set).

Calling the Enable() function will cause the tables for this translation to
be initialized. If the desired code page is not 437, they will be read from
a file.

Strings longer than 64K may be translated.


OemToAnsiBuff(lpSrc, lpDst, nCount)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function performs the same translations as OemToAnsi(), but is used for
translating fixed-length byte arrays, such as database records, which may
contain NULL bytes.

╓┌─────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Parameter         Description
Parameter         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpSrc             A long pointer to the input ANSI string.
lpDst             A long pointer to the output OEM string.
nCount            The byte count.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

lpSrc and lpDst may be the same.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Return Value

Undefined


ScreenSwitchEnable(wEnable)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function enables or disables screen switching under OS/2. It does not
apply to running under MS-DOS.

╓┌─────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Parameter         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
wEnable           Zero for disable, non-zero for enable.



Return Value

Undefined


Comments

This function is called by the display driver to inform the keyboard driver
that the display driver is in a critical section and, therefore, it should
ignore all OS/2 screen switches until the display driver leaves its critical
section.

The parameter is saved as a flag that is tested in the interrupt function;
if it is zero, the OS/2 key combination for screen switching is ignored.

On entry, screen switches are enabled.


SetSpeed(Rate)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function is used by Control Panel and by Windows initialization to set
the repeat rate of the keyboard.

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rate                              An integer value. The lowest 5 bits define
                                  the desired repeat rate.
                                  If Rate is -1, this function returns a
                                  value indicating speed-setting capability.




Return Value

If rate_of_speed = -1

    AX = -1 if not speed capable AX = 0 if yes capable

If rate_of_speed does not = -1

    AX = speed actually set on keyboard AX = -1 if unsuccessful


Comments

This function is used in conjunction with a Control Panel dialog for setting
the keyboard repeat rate.

If the keyboard speed cannot be set from software, this function may be
reduced to a stub which always returns -1. In that case, the Control Panel
program will not display a menu selection for setting keyboard speed.


ToAscii(VirtKey, Scancode, lpKeyState, lpState, KeyFlags)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

            bits are bits 24..31 of the
            WM_KEYDOWN or WM_KEYUP message's
            lParam.

            The low byte is the hardware
            scan code. The UP/DOWN bit is
            not included. Bit 7 is normally
            0. The scan code is used mainly
            in the translation of ALT+number
            pad character code input.

lpKeyState  The vector of key state flags
            maintained in USER. (See the

                                  accent and a dead key character, when a
                                  dead key cannot be translated otherwise).

1                                 One ANSI character is returned.

0                                 This virtual key code has no translation
                                  (for the current state of shift keys, etc).

-1                                This key is a dead key. The character
                                  returned is normally an ANSI accent
                                  character representing the dead key.




Comments

ToAscii() is called mainly whenever TranslateMessage() is called to
translate a virtual key code (e.g., for WM_KEYDOWN messages).

The given parameters to ToAscii() are not necessarily sufficient to
translate the virtual key code. This is because a previous dead key is
stored internally in the driver. Also, the MS-DOS shift state byte is
accessed by ToAscii().

ToAscii() is responsible for maintaining the state of the keyboard LED
indicator lights. For most AT-compatible systems, this is done by making a
ROM BIOS interrupt 16H call; for others, I/O must be done directly to the
keyboard.

ToAscii() also has a special case which, if it is called with the virtual
key code = 0, will only set the keyboard lights according to the state of
the appropriate entries in the keyboard state vector. This function is
intended to be called from the USER function SetKeyboardState() and not used
directly by applications. The Scancode parameter is ignored. The vector
pointed to by lpState should be different from the one used by normal
ToAscii() calls in USER and at least 4 bytes long.

Most translations are made on the basis of the Windows virtual key code.
However, the Scancode parameter's sign bit is used to distinguish key
depressions (sign cleared) from key releases (sign set). Also, the scan code
is used in the translation of ALT + number key translations.

The lpKeyState parameter points to a 256-byte vector indexed by the virtual
key code. In each byte, the high-order bit indicates the state of the key
and the low-order bit is toggled each time the key is pressed. The CAPSLOCK
key is handled in a special manner for some European keyboards.

The lpState parameter points to a data buffer that contains the translated
character(s) and state information. The Inquire function in the KBINFO
structure returns the size required for this state buffer.


VkKeyScan(wChar)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Description

This function translates an ANSI character code into a virtual key code and
a shift state. It is intended for applications that send text to other
applications by simulating keyboard input.

╓┌────────────────────────┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Parameter                Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
wChar                    An ANSI character



Return Value

AL = Windows virtual key code

AH = Shift state

 0 No shift  1 Character is shifted  2 Character is CTRL character  6
Character is CTRL + ALT  7 Character is SHIFT + CTRL + ALT  3,4,5 These
combinations never occur.

If no key with this translation is found, -1 is returned in AX.


Comments

Virtual key codes applying to the numeric pad (VK_NUMPAD0..VK_DIVIDE) are
not returned. This is done to force a translation for the main keyboard, if
it exists.






Chapter 9  Miscellaneous Drivers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This chapter provides some basic information on several device drivers for
which source code is included with the Microsoft Windows Device Development
Kit (DDK).

In most cases, there will be no need to modify the drivers shipped with
Windows. However, if you need to customize them, the source for the standard
versions is provided on one of the disks included with the DDK. We recommend
that you modify these instead of writing your own.


9.1  Sound Drivers

None of the new feature enhancements in Windows 3.0 affects sound drivers.

However, we recommend that you rebuild your Windows 2.x driver with the new
Windows 3.0 building tools provided in the Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit (SDK). You should also thoroughly test your driver under
Windows 3.0, and especially while running in protected mode. This will
ensure full compatibility with Windows 3.0.

The Windows sound driver generates the sounds specified by a parameter
block. The block is a series of notes whose first WORD specifies the number
of notes. Each subsequent pair of WORDs defines the duration of the note (in
milliseconds) and the frequency of the note. The APIs that this driver
supports are fully defined in the SDK.


9.2  Communications Drivers

The Windows communications driver source code has been enhanced from earlier
versions of Windows. It now supports the COM3 and COM4 ports, as well as
bimodal operation for real and protected modes.

The Windows communications driver has entries that assign and de-assign
serial device instances to ports, enable and disable interrupt handlers for
input from assigned serial  devices, and send and receive characters to
assigned serial output devices. The data transmission protocol is
communicated in a Device Control Block (DCB) when the serial device is
assigned.

The APIs that this driver supports are fully defined in the SDK. The Device
Control Block structure, however, is provided in this section for your
convenience.


9.2.1  DCB ─ Device Control Block Structure

RS-232 configuration parameters are communicated in a Device Control Block
(DCB). The DCB structure is defined below; the C-structure definition is
given.

  typedef struct {

                                  The transmitter will halt if an X-OFF
                                  character is received, and start again
                                  when an X-ON character is received.

9.3  Mouse Drivers

The Windows mouse driver provides the following:


  ■   Initialization and termination functions for the mouse

  ■   Information about whether or not a mouse is connected to the system

  ■   The number of buttons on the mouse

  ■   The rate at which it generates interrupts

  ■   The threshold for acceleration of horizontal and vertical motion

  ■   The resolution of the screen


The mouse hardware interrupt handler is called whenever the mouse generates
an interrupt. The interrupt handler must place state flags in AX. These
flags include information about whether or not the mouse has moved and about
button transitions.

The low-order bit is set if there was movement since the last interrupt;
otherwise, it is cleared. Bits 2-15 in AX specify the state of the buttons,
which are numbered 1-N for this purpose. Bit 2N is set if button N is
depressed, bit 2N+1 is set if button N is up. DX is set to the number of
buttons.

If there has been mouse motion (low-order bit of AX is set), BX and CX hold
the integer values of motion since the last mouse interrupt was generated
for X and Y, respectively. When this data is in place, the interrupt handler
calls an event-handling procedure supplied by Microsoft Windows.


9.3.1  Mouse Functions

The following three functions are specific to the mouse driver.


Inquire(lpMOUSEINFO)

This primitive returns information about the mouse hardware.

The lpMOUSEINFO parameter is a long pointer to a data structure of type
MOUSEINFO. The structure contains information about the mouse hardware that
is present, the number of buttons on the mouse, and the rate at which the
mouse can issue interrupts.

On return, AX holds the number of bytes actually written into the data
structure.


Enable (lpEventProc)

This primitive sets up the mouse to call the procedure whose address was
passed for each mouse interrupt.

The lpEventProc parameter is a long pointer to the procedure that is to be
called for each mouse interrupt.


Disable( )

This primitive removes the existing interrupt procedure from the mouse
driver. After a call to this procedure, there will be no support for
interrupts from the mouse driver.


9.3.2  Addition to MOUSE.DEF

A call has been added to MOUSE.DEF for enhanced Windows initialization
support. This call,

  MouseGetIntVect @4

returns the mouse's vector number under MS-DOS. If there is no physical
mouse, it returns -1.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

Under OS/2, some interrupt vectors are not shareable, including the mouse
interrupt. To determine whether or not a mouse driver is already installed,
you can do the following:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  xor AX,AX
  int 33h

If the interrupt returns != 0, then a mouse driver is, indeed, installed,
and you must use it. If it returns 0, you may install your driver.
If you are not operating under OS/2, you can still check for an installed
mouse driver. However, you are not obliged to use it; you may replace it
with your own.

9.3.3  MOUSEINFO ─ Mouse Hardware Characteristics Structure

The values of the fields in this structure should be set so that they
correctly reflect the relationship between quadrature changes and pixel
movement for the system's mouse and the usual display.

  typedef struct {
   char   msExist;
   char   msRelative;
   short  msNumButtons;
   short  msRate;
   short  msXThreshold;
   short  msYThreshold;
   short  msXRes;
   short  msYRes;
   } MOUSEINFO;

The following is a description of the fields in this structure:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
msExist                           Nonzero if the device initialization code
                                  was able to find and initialize a mouse
                                  device.

msRelative                        Nonzero if the mouse device is set to
                                  return coordinates relative to the
                                  previous position. It is zero if the mouse
                                  returns absolute coordinates.

msNumButtons                      Identifies how many buttons are on the
                                  installed mouse. For the IBM PC with a
                                  Microsoft Mouse, this field is set to 2.

PART II  General Reference for Device Drivers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This second part of the Microsoft Windows Device Driver Adaptation Guide
provides reference-type information that is common to many of the Windows
3.0 device drivers when running in real and standard mode.

Part 1, "Writing Windows Device Drivers," also contains some of the same
information on functions and data structures. However, those descriptions
were limited in scope, and specific to the device driver chapter in which
they appeared. In this part, the information is presented both in a more
general and a more detailed manner.






Chapter 10  Common Functions
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This chapter describes the common functions used by Microsoft Windows
graphics output device drivers. The functions performed by a GDI device
driver fall into the following groups: control, environment, information,
output, attribute, and cursor.

The following are the control functions (with their ordinal reference
numbers) that Windows uses to initialize and disable the physical display
and to control the various output operations.


  ■   Control() @ 3

  ■   Disable() @ 4

  ■   Enable() @ 5

  ■   WEP()


The DeviceMode() environment function is called by applications and is
required to be in the printer driver. GDI also has two environment functions
(GetEnvironment() and SetEnvironment()) that can be used by device drivers
to manage the printing environment for a given port.


  ■   DeviceMode() @ 13


The following information functions (with their ordinal reference numbers)
pass information about the graphics peripheral to which this device driver
is attached. This information includes the physical characteristics
(technology, size of output surface, resolution, colors, etc.) of the
graphics peripheral, and information about the capabilities of the device
driver. The functions also pass information about fonts or other data
structures.


  ■   ColorInfo() @ 2

  ■   DeviceBitmap() @16

  ■   Enable() @ 5

  ■   EnumDFonts() @ 6

  ■   EnumObj() @ 7

  ■   GetCharWidth() @15


The following output functions (with their ordinal reference numbers)
perform all the actual graphics operations on the display surface. Output is
made to the device output surface or to a bitmap in memory. Most of these
functions are required for display and printer drivers. FastBorder() and
StretchBlt() are optional for display drivers.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

The output functions must not overwrite the display cursor while it is still
on the display screen. Each function must check for the location of the
cursor and remove it from the screen if it is in any portion of the screen
to be updated or read. This ensures that the cursor, if visible at all, is
on the top level of the screen. i.e., "in front of" all the other items. The
origin is the upper-left corner of the display surface. Notice that X
increases when going to the right, and Y increases when going downward.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


  ■   BitBlt() @ 1

  ■   ExtTextOut() @ 14

  ■   FastBorder() @ 17

  ■   Output() @ 8

  ■   Pixel() @ 9

  ■   SaveScreenBitmap() @ 92

  ■   ScanLR() @ 12

  ■   StretchBlt() @ 27

  ■   StrBlt() @ 11


The following display attribute functions (with their ordinal reference
numbers) handle the creation of physical representations of attribute
bundles suitable for the device. Those physical representations are the
actual parameters to output primitive calls.


  ■   RealizeObject() @10

  ■   SetAttribute() @18


The following cursor functions (with their ordinal reference numbers) allow
the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to take advantage of any special
cursor display hardware. The OEM is responsible for hiding the cursor, if
necessary, when the screen display changes. These functions provide position
and visibility control of the cursor, and the ability to specify the bitmap
to be displayed as the cursor. They are used for dedicated display modules
only.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

A cursor consists of two monochrome bitmaps: an AND mask (applied first at
the current screen position) and an XOR mask (applied after the AND mask).
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


  ■   CheckCursor() @104

  ■   Inquire() @101

  ■   MoveCursor() @103

  ■   SetCursor() @ 102


Detailed descriptions of all the functions listed above follow this
introductory section and are presented in alphabetical order.


BitBlt()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

BitBlt (lpDestDev, wDestXOrg, wDestYOrg, lpSrcDev, wSrcXOrg, wSrcYOrg,
wXext, wYext, Rop3, lpPBrush, lpDrawMode)

Transfers bits delimited by a source rectangle from the source bitmap to the
area delimited by a destination rectangle on the destination bitmap. The
type of transfer is controlled by the raster operation that allows the
specification of all the possible Boolean operations on three variables
(source, destination, and the pattern in the brush). Notice that the source
and destination may overlap, so the implementation must be careful about the
direction in which bits are copied. (See Section 2.5, "The BitBlt Function,"
for a more detailed discussion of the function and its parameters.)

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►

                                  conversions in bitmaps.

Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────




Return Value

None


Comments

The source and destination rectangles, defined by their origin and extent on
each PDEVICE (in bitmap units), are the same size and may overlap. When this
function is used for filling the destination rectangle with a brush, the
source device is ignored.

Refer to the GDIINFO data structure for a description of how BitBlt
registers its output capabilities.

When the source, brush pattern, and destination are not in the same color
format, BitBlt must convert the source and brush pattern to the same format
before copying to the destination.

To convert a monochrome bitmap to a color bitmap, BitBlt must do the
following:


  1.  Convert white bits (1) to the background color given in DRAWMODE.

  2.  Convert black bits (0) to the text (foreground) color given in
      DRAWMODE.


To convert a color bitmap to a monochrome bitmap, BitBlt must do the
following:


  1.  Convert all pixels that match the background color to white (1).

  2.  Convert all pixels that do not match the background color to black
      (0).


The current background and foreground colors are defined by the current
drawing mode pointed to by lpDrawMode.

See also the discussion on patterned brushes under the RealizeObject()
function.


CheckCursor()

Syntax

CheckCursor ()

This function is called on every timer interrupt. It allows the cursor to be
displayed if it is no longer excluded.


Return Value

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

ColorInfo (lpDestDev, dwColorin, lpPCOLOR) : rgbColor

This function converts RGB color values to physical colors and vice versa.
The operation to be performed depends on the value of lpPCOLOR.

If lpPCOLOR is a nonzero value, dwColorin is assumed to be an RGB color
value. The function should choose the best possible physical color to match
this color and, then, copy this physical color to the location pointed to by
lpPCOLOR and return the RGB color value that corresponds to this physical
color.

If lpPCOLOR is NULL, dwColorin is assumed to be a physical color and the
function should return the corresponding RGB color value.

On a palette-capable device, if the physical color passed in dwColorin
refers to a non-static color, ColorInfo has to detect that case and return
0FF00iiiiH. Otherwise, it should return the corresponding RGB value.

Physical colors returned by this function are only used by GDI to set text
colors, background colors, and pixel colors using the Pixel() function.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
dwColorin                         A long integer that holds the desired
                                  intensities of red, green, and blue (each
                                  of 8 bits). The color definition occupies
                                  3 bytes of the long integer, with red in
                                  the low byte, green in the second byte,
                                  blue in the third byte, and the fourth
                                  byte reserved.

lpPCOLOR                          A long pointer to a variable of type
                                  PCOLOR. See the PCOLOR description in
                                  Chapter 12, "Data Structures and File
                                  Formats."




Return Value

The rgbColor value is a long integer that holds the intensities of red,
green, and blue (each of 8 bits) of the actual color that the device would
use if asked to perform the dwColorin color.

For palette-capable devices only, the high WORD of dwColorin can be either 0
or 0FFH. If the high byte equals 0FFH, then an index (not an RGB) is in the
low WORD. Just return the index that was passed in. No color conversion
needs to be performed.


Comments

On a palette-capable device, when the device is converting a physical color
to a logical color (i.e., when lpPCOLOR is NULL), it should do the following
to provide for ColorInfo a more valid separation of the static colors and
the palette-managed colors in the system.

If the physical color (i.e., an index in this case) refers to one of the
static system colors, then the function should return the logical RGB of
that color, which will look like 0x00rrggbb. Otherwise, it should return the
index of the color in the form 0xFF00iiii. This palette-managed index will
then be looked up by GDI to find the actual RGB value.

Windows. It currently returns AX = 0.


Comments

You must set up the stack frame correctly to ensure correct returns to GDI
should the stub ever be called.


DeviceMode()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

DeviceMode (hWnd, hInstance, lpDestDevType, lpOutputfile)

The DeviceMode function sets the current printing modes for the graphics
device by prompting for those modes using a dialog box. An application calls
DeviceMode directly when it wants the user to change the printing modes of
the corresponding device. The function copies the mode information to the
environment block associated with the device and kept by GDI. GDI
initializes this environment block when the application calls CreateDC, and
gives access to it through the SetEnvironment and GetEnvironment functions.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
hWnd                              A handle to the application's window.

                                  containing the device name. The
                                  application passes the same device type
                                  name as given in the CreateDC function.

lpOutputfile                      A long pointer to a NULL-terminated string
                                  containing the name of an MS-DOS file or
                                  device port. The application passes the
                                  same device type name as given in the
                                  CreateDC function.




Return Value

None


Comments

DeviceMode should be included in and exported from any graphics device
driver that permits the user to change modes.

The driver should allow all dialog boxes created with DeviceMode to be
dismissed at any time by pressing ESC. This is because the Help application,
when setting up printers, must be able to respond to a request for help from
another application at any time. It will try to do so by sending a
WM_COMMAND (IDCANCEL) message (equivalent to pressing the ESC key) to all
its task windows, including those brought up by the device driver.

To determine if your code does the right thing, do the following test:


  1.  From Program Manager, choose the File and Run commands and, then, run
      WINHELP.EXE.

  2.  From WINHELP, choose the File and Printer Setup commands.

  3.  Select your printer and press the Setup button.

  4.  Then, from every state reachable from that point, press ALT + ESC and
      F1.


Help should respond by removing all its dialog boxes (including all the
device driver dialog boxes) and displaying help for Program Manager.


Disable()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

Disable (lpDestDev)

If the Windows session is ending or if a non-Windows application is being
run, the device needs to be disabled. In the case of a non-Windows
application, the device will be re-enabled later by a call to Enable. This
call disables the device for either purpose.

Enable()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

Enable (lpDestDev, wStyle, lpDestDevType, lpOutputFile, lpData) : wSize

This function initializes a device driver or returns information about the
driver as defined by the value of Style.

This function should save the current hardware state in static storage
(usually within the PDEVICE data structure passed) so that it can be
restored when Windows terminates.

For more information on how display drivers use this function, see Chapter
2, "Display Drivers." Some other drivers (such as the network, keyboard, and

               or a NULL string for the
               dedicated system display. This

               the environment of the given
               physical device. It can be
               NULL if no such information is
               needed.




Return Value

On return, AX holds zero if it is unsuccessful (e.g., hardware is not
initialized). Otherwise, AX returns nonzero.


Comments

This function will be called only twice for most physical devices. It is
called the first time with lpDestDev to get the desired size of the device
block and the second time to fill in lpDestDev. It can be called more than
twice for a display (e.g., if a non-Windows application is run). This
requires that the display be disabled and, when the application is
terminated, re-enabled.

In some cases, GDI may request a raster device to write on a memory bitmap
without enabling the device first. This occurs only with raster devices that
can write to memory bitmaps.


EnumDFonts()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

EnumDFonts (lpDestDev, lpFaceName, lpCallbackFunc, lpClientData) :

This function is used to enumerate the fonts available on the device. For
each appropriate font, the callback function is called with the information
for that font. The callback function is called until there are no more fonts
or the callback function returns zero.

lpClientData                      A long pointer to the user-supplied data.




Return Value

This function returns the last value returned by the callback function.


Comments

The callback function has the following form:

CallbackFunction (lpLogFont, lpTextMetrics, wFontType, lpClientData)

where lpLogFont is a long pointer to a data structure of type LOGFONT
defined such that it maps to the enumerated font; lpTextMetrics is a long
pointer to a data structure of type TEXTMETRIC defined with the values that
would be returned by a GetTextMetrics call; wFontType is an integer value
indicating the type of the font; and lpClientData is a long pointer to the
user-supplied data passed to EnumDFonts. Sizes are in device units.

The label "RASTER_FONTTYPE" is to be ORed into wFontType to indicate that
the font is composed of a raster bitmap rather than vector strokes. If the
device is capable of text transformations such as scaling, embolding, and
italicizing, only the base font will be enumerated. The user is responsible
for inquiring about the device's text transformation abilities to determine
which additional fonts are available directly from the device.


EnumObj()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

EnumObj (lpDestDev, wStyle, lpCallbackFunc, lpClientData) : wLastCallback

This function is used to enumerate the pens and brushes available on the
device. For each object belonging to the given style, the callback function
is called with the information for that object. The callback function is
called until there are no more objects or the callback function returns
zero.

                                  enumerated. If there are no objects of
                                  that type, none is enumerated and EnumObj
                                  returns 1.

lpCallbackFunc                    A long pointer to the user-supplied
                                  callback function.

lpClientData                      A long pointer to the user-supplied data.




Return Value

This function returns the last value returned by the callback function.


Comments

The callback function has the following form:

CallbackFunction(lpLogObj, lpClientData)

where lpLogObj is a long pointer to a data structure of type LOGPEN or
LOGBRUSH, depending on the style selected (EnumObj must map each physical
object to a logical object before passing to the callback function); and
lpClientData is a long pointer to the user-supplied data passed to EnumObj.


When initializing, some older applications (such as Microsoft Excel for
versions earlier than 2.1) mistakenly expected the first eight pens returned
to them through the EnumObj function to be the eight default EGA colors.
Therefore, even though their pens are not normally enumerated in that EGA
order, driver writers should first return the eight default EGA pens (shown
in the following list) with these RGB values and, then, enumerate as many
others as they want to enumerate. They should do this for both brushes and
pens.

This standard order for enumerating pens and brushes is also useful when you
have a device with full 24-bit resolution. First, you enumerate the eight
standard colors. Then, you can enumerate your own colors. However, you
should also consider here the color applications, such as Microsoft Excel,
that enumerate 16 colors. Therefore, we recommend you pick the eight most
desirable colors. Then, after the first 16 are enumerated, if the program
asks for more colors, you can select another set of colors up to a total of
256 colors.

We also recommend that you enumerate your solid pens first and, then, if you
want to do so, the patterned ones.

For brushes, enumerate only the solid ones. And if they can be dithered,
enumerate only the "true" solid ones. GDI already knows about the hatched
ones.

When enumerating brushes, the background color for hatched brushes is not
returned.


ExtTextOut()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

ExtTextOut (lpDestDev, wDestXOrg, wDestYOrg, lpClipRect, lpString, wCount,
lpFontInfo, lpDrawMode, lpTextXForm, lpCharWidths, lpOpaqueRect, wOptions) :
dwSuccess

This function transfers the pattern for each character in the string from
the font bitmap to the destination device, starting at the origin passed. In
each character pattern, a one bit specifies the character foreground, and a
zero bit specifies the character background. It is effectively the Windows
2.0 and later StrBlt function. (See Section 2.6,"The StrBlt/ExtTextOut
Functions," for a more detailed discussion of the function and its
parameters.) It is an optional function for printers, but highly
recommended.

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpDestDev                         A long pointer to the destination PDEVICE
                                  or BITMAP data structure.

Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

wDestXOrg                         The left origin of the string.

wDestYOrg                         The top origin of the string.

lpClipRect                        A long pointer to the clipping rectangle.
                                  Only pixels within the rectangle are to be
                                  drawn. The upper-left corner of the
                                  rectangle is assumed to be located at the
                                  upper-left corner of a pixel (not the
                                  center). Thus, no pixels are drawn if the
                                  clipping rectangle is empty (zero width
                                  and height), and only one pixel is drawn
                                  if it has a width and height of 1. See
                                  also the description of the RECT data
                                  structure in Chapter 12, "Data Structures
                                  and File Formats."

lpString                          A long pointer to the string itself.
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpString                          A long pointer to the string itself.

wCount                            wCount has one of three meanings:

                                  If wCount is greater than zero, it is the
                                  number of characters to display from the
                                  string. The placement of characters is
                                  determined by the state of the
                                  Differential Data Analyzer (DDA) in the
                                  DRAWMODE structure. On exit, the DDA must
                                  be reset to its original state. (BreakErr
                                  is left as it was upon entry to StrBlt or
                                  ExtTextOut.)

                                  If wCount is less than zero, no output is
                                  produced, and the extent of the string is
                                  returned as a long integer. The X and Y
                                  values of the extent are 16-bit quantities
                                  packed with Y in the high WORD and X in
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  packed with Y in the high WORD and X in
                                  the low WORD. The extent is defined as the
                                  bounding box in pixels that the string
                                  would occupy if the clipping rectangle
                                  were infinite. The size of the string is
                                  determined by the state of the DDA in the
                                  DRAWMODE structure. On exit, the DDA must
                                  be set to its new state as advanced by the
                                  contents of the string. (BreakErr is
                                  modified.)

                                  If wCount is zero, then check the wOptions
                                  flag. If the 2s bit is set in the wOptions
                                  flag, then it infers that you have to draw
                                  an opaque rectangle. See Section 2.6, "The
                                  StrBlt/ExtTextOut Functions," for a more
                                  detailed discussion.

lpFontInfo                        A long pointer to a data structure of type
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpFontInfo                        A long pointer to a data structure of type
                                  FONTINFO that represents the physical font
                                  in use.

lpDrawMode                        A long pointer to a data structure of type
                                  DRAWMODE that
                                  includes the current text color,
                                  background mode, background color, text
                                  justification, and character spacing.
                                  Refer to the DRAWMODE data structure
                                  description in Chapter 12, "Data
                                  Structures and File Formats," for a
                                  description of text justification and
                                  character spacing.

lpTextXForm                       A long pointer to a data structure of type
                                  TEXTXFORM that describes text appearance
                                  that may differ from the actual values
                                  specified by lpFontInfo. This parameter
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  specified by lpFontInfo. This parameter
                                  allows more capable devices to make
                                  changes to the standard font. For example,
                                  if ExtTextOut (or StrBlt) registers itself
                                  as capable of sizing characters,
                                  lpTextXForm may specify a point size
                                  different from the one specified by
                                  lpFontInfo. If a 16-point font replaces an
                                  8-point font, ExtTextOut must do bit
                                  doubling (or vector doubling) to produce
                                  the desired font size. If ExtTextOut has
                                  no transformation capabilities and
                                  registers itself as such, the lpTextXForm
                                  parameter may be ignored.

lpCharWidths                      The user may exercise explicit control
                                  over the spacing of each character by
                                  passing in a vector of x movements. If
                                  lpCharWidths is non-NULL, then
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  lpCharWidths is non-NULL, then
                                  lpCharWidths[n] is the adjustment from the
                                  start of the nth character to character n
                                  +1. This number may be larger or smaller
                                  than the actual width of the nth character.

lpOpaqueRect                      If non-NULL, a long pointer to the
                                  opaquing rectangle.

wOptions                          An integer with bits set to indicate
                                  ExtTextOut options.

                                  If ETO_OPAQUE (0x0002) is set in the
                                  wOptions flag, then the rectangle pointed
                                  to by lpOpaqueRect is to be intersected
                                  with the rectangle pointed to by
                                  lpClipRect, with the resulting area being
                                  used to clip the string.

Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

                                  If ETO_CLIPPED (0x0004) is set in the
                                  wOptions flag, then the rectangle pointed
                                  to by lpOpaqueRect is to be intersected
                                  with the rectangle pointed to by
                                  lpClipRect, and the resulting area filled
                                  with the background color given in
                                  DRAWMODE. The area is to be filled
                                  regardless of opaque/transparent mode.
                                  Notice that the text-string bounding box
                                  and the opaquing rectangle are allowed to
                                  be disjoint rectangles.




Return Value

Under certain circumstances, (e.g., if the specified font is not supported),
ExtTextOut returns DX:AX = 8000:0000H to signify an error.

Otherwise, it returns DX:AX = 0000:0000H to signify success.

However, if wCount =&lt; 0, it returns DX:AX = Yext:Xext


Comments

See the GDIINFO data structure description in Chapter 12, "Data Structures
and File Formats," for a description of how ExtTextOut registers its output
capabilities and their meanings.

The upper-left corner of the string is placed starting at the point defined
by DestYOrg. This means that the characters in the string appear below and
to the right of the starting point.

ExtTextOut uses the current drawing mode to determine the current text
color, the background mode (or Transparent/Opaque flag), and the background
color. The background mode determines whether or not ExtTextOut must draw an
opaque bounding box before drawing the characters. The background color
determines what color that box must be. ExtTextOut does not use the current
binary raster operation mode (ROP2).

For further information on TEXTXFORM, see Chapter 13, "The Font File
Format."


FastBorder()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

FastBorder (lpRect, wHorizBorderThick, wVertBorderThick, dwRasterOp,
lpDestDev, lpPBrush, lpDrawMode, lpClipRect) : wSuccess

This function draws a rectangle with a border on the screen. However, the
size is subject to the limits imposed by the specified clipping rectangle.
The border is drawn within the boundaries of the specified rectangle.

lpClipRect                        A long pointer to the clipping rectangle.




Return Value

FastBorder returns AX = 0 on error, AX = 1 on success.


Comments

The specified rectangle should be given as (UpperLeftCorner,
LowerRightCorner). If it is specified incorrectly, the sample function will
draw the borders outside of the specified rectangle, instead of correctly
drawing them inside.

The function is optional for display drivers. It is required at the GDI
level but not at the display level.

The raster operation to be used will never have a source operand within it.


The lpDrawMode parameter is simply a long pointer to the DRAWMODE data
structure. It is included only for compatibility with earlier versions and
is not crucial. The only field that you may use from there is
BackgroundColor.

                                  display drivers.)

lpFontTrans                       A long pointer to a data structure of type
                                  TEXTXFORM. (Only needed if the device can
                                  do font transformations, such as scaling

Return Value

This function returns its information in a buffer to which lpBuffer points.
In the event of an error, it returns AX = 0.


Inquire()

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpCURSORINFO                      A long pointer to a device information
                                  block (data type CURSORINFO) that is
                                  filled in by the device driver. The first
                                  WORD is the X mickey-to-pixel ratio, and
                                  the second WORD is the Y mickey-to-pixel
                                  ratio.




Return Value

On return, AX holds the number of bytes (4) actually written into the data
structure.


Comments

This function is called once per initialization before the Enable function.



MoveCursor()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

MoveCursor (wAbsX, wAbsY)

This function moves the cursor to the given screen coordinates. If the
cursor is a composite of screen and cursor bitmaps (i.e., not a hardware
cursor), this function must ensure that screen bits under the current cursor
position are restored and the bits under the new position are saved. The
function must move the cursor, even if the cursor is not currently
displayed.

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
wAbsX and wAbsY                   Absolute X and Y screen coordinates of the
                                  new cursor position.




Return Value

None.


Comments

Microsoft Windows may specify a position at which the cursor shape would lie
partially outside of the display bitmap. The OEM function is responsible for
clipping the cursor shape to the display boundary.

The MoveCursor function is called at mouse interrupt time, outside of the
main thread of Windows processing. Since MoveCursor may even interrupt its
own processing, the device driver should disable interrupts while reading
the wAbsX and wAbsY coordinates by using the EnterCrit and LeaveCrit macros
in the WINDEFS.INC file. Do not use STI and CLI instructions in the driver.



Output()

wStyle                            A short integer that defines the type of
                                  geometric primitive to be drawn. The
                                  interpretation of the remaining parameters
                                  depends on the style. The available style
                                  primitives are described following the

wCount                            A 16-bit integer specifying the number of
                                  points in the points list.

Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

lpPoints                          A long pointer to an array of short
                                  integers. The array has wCount elements,
                                  and each element contains two short
                                  integers. For most of the output
                                  primitives, these are simply the device
                                  coordinates for each point on the figure.

lpPPen                            A long pointer to a data structure of type
                                  PPEN.

lpPBrush                          A long pointer to a data structure of type
                                  PBRUSH.

lpDrawMode                        A long pointer to a data structure of type

lpClipRect                        A long pointer to the clipping rectangle
                                  to be used to clip output. For polygons
                                  and lines, lpClipRect contains the
                                  bounding box of all the lines to be drawn.
                                  This parameter is ignored if the device is
                                  unable to clip (see the dpClip field of
                                  the GDIINFO structure). See also the RECT
                                  data structure. Both structures are
                                  described in Chapter 12, "Data Structures
                                  and File Formats."

                                  If lpClipRect is zero, then the clipping
                                  rectangle is the entire display surface.

Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────




Return Value

Output returns the following:


  ■   AX=  1: Success

  ■   AX=  0: Unrecoverable failure

  ■   AX= -1: Device driver could not support the passed style. GDI will
      simulate it.


See the GDIINFO data structure for a description of how Output registers its
output capabilities and their meanings.


Comments

The lpClipRect parameter should be intersected as well with the bitmap or
dimensions of the display surface. The display driver should do it and not
rely on GDI to do it.

The lpClipRect parameter is in effect in the GDIINFO data structure only if
the dpClip field says that you can clip. Otherwise, the device can ignore it
because the device cannot clip itself.

The only Output styles required by Windows 2.0 and later GDI versions were
OS_SCANLINES and OS_POLYLINES. With certain "smart" devices, you may want to
use the device's capability to draw complex figures. However, in many cases
the device is either limited by such things as the number of vertices in a
polygon or is not able to draw these complex figures into a main memory
bitmap, although it can draw them to the screen. In these cases, the device
driver is now allowed to return a -1 failure code. When GDI receives this
return code, it breaks the complex figure into component scanlines and
polylines and draws the figure with them.

The defined styles are listed in this Comments section, with a brief
description of what the Output primitive does when each style is specified.
The style type determines which of the parameters in the Output primitive
contain meaningful information. The lpDestDev (device pointer) and
lpDrawMode (raster op) parameters are common to all style types and are not
described further here.

For styles that define a closed area, the current interior pattern specified
by the lpPBrush parameter is used. For styles that define lines or borders,
the current line pattern specified by the lpPPen parameter is used.

If Output passed both a pen and a brush (i.e., if neither lpPBrush nor
lpPPen is NULL), then the interior should be drawn first with the brush,
followed by the border drawn with the pen. If either object is NULL, it is
not used in the output (i.e., if lpPBrush = NULL, the interior will not be
filled).

The lpPoints parameter points to an array of pairs of short integers that
designate the points used to produce the style specified. When the number of
points required to produce a style can vary (e.g., the polygon), the wCount
parameter specifies the exact number of points. For arc styles, wCount is
always five, specifying two points for the upper-left and lower-right
corners of the bounding rectangle, a start point, a stop point, and a
special point structure that actually contains the pair of angles used to
sweep out the arc. The circle and ellipse styles use only the first two of
these points. The other styles use the wCount and lpPoints parameters to
produce the appropriate output.

All the styles are briefly described below:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────╖

OS_ARC (3)                        Causes an arc to be drawn on the device.
                                  If the points are all the same, a point
                                  is drawn. If they are collinear, a line
                                  is drawn. Otherwise, a circular arc is
                                  defined that passes from the start to
                                  the stop point (counterclockwise, as
                                  defined by the upper and lower points
                                  and the size of the specified angles).

                                  and the size of the specified angles).
                                  This style does not define a closed
                                  figure even if the start and stop points
                                  are identical.

OS_PIE (23)                       Causes a Pie-type closed arc to be drawn
                                  on the device. The arc is drawn as
                                  described above, then two additional
                                  lines are drawn (one from each endpoint)
                                  to the implicit center of the circular
                                  arc, defining a wedge-shaped enclosed
                                  area which is filled.

OS_CHORD (39)                     Causes a Chord-type closed arc to be
                                  drawn on the device. The arc is drawn as
                                  described above, then the two endpoints
                                  are connected with a straight line and
                                  the enclosed area is filled.

OS_CIRCLE (55)                    Causes a circle to be drawn on the
                                  device. The circle is centered at the
                                  implicit center, determined by the
                                  upper-leftmost and lower-rightmost
                                  points passed, and has a radius equal to
                                  half the width of the rectangle. A zero
                                  radius colors a pixel at the center of
                                  the circle.

OS_ELLIPSE (7)                    Causes an ellipse to be drawn on the
                                  device. The ellipse is centered at the
                                  implicit center, determined by the
                                  upper-leftmost and lower-rightmost
                                  points passed. It also has the width and
                                  height implied by these points.

OS_ALTERNATE_FILL_  POLYGON (22)  Specifies a polygonal area that is to be
                                  drawn on the device and filled using the

                                  alternate filling method (i.e., every
                                  other enclosed region within a complex
                                  polygon is filled). The wCount parameter
                                  contains the number of points to be
                                  passed. The polygon is drawn from the
                                  first point, passed through subsequent
                                  points, and closed back to the first
                                  point, if necessary.

OS_WINDPOLYGON (20)               Formerly called Winding Number Fill
                                  Polygon, and also known as OS_TRAPEZOID,
                                  it specifies a polygonal area that is to
                                  be drawn on the device and filled using
                                  the winding number filling method (i.e.,
                                  only enclosed regions within a complex
                                  polygon are filled). The wCount
                                  parameter contains the number of points
                                  to be passed. The polygon is drawn from

                                  the first point, passed through
                                  subsequent points, and closed back to
                                  the first point, if necessary.

OS_RECTANGLE (6)                  Causes a rectangle to be drawn on the
                                  device, using two points passed as the
                                  two corners. If the corner points are
                                  called (X1,Y1),(X2,Y2), then the driver
                                  should draw a rectangle defined by
                                  (X1,Y1) and (X2-1,Y2-1) and exclude the
                                  bottom-right corner. For more

OS_POLYLINE (18)                  Causes a set of line segments to be
                                  drawn on the device. The value of wCount
Style                             Description

                                  drawn on the device. The value of wCount
                                  must be at least two. Each line segment
                                  is drawn from its starting point up to,
                                  but not including, its end point. If
                                  more than one line segment is drawn,
                                  each new segment starts at the end point
                                  of the previous segment. Polylines do
                                  not define filled areas and are not
                                  implicitly closed. This style is
                                  required for both raster and vector
                                  devices. Polylines do not use brushes.
                                  The line style is determined from lpPPen.

OS_SCANLINES (4)                  Provides a means to rapidly fill a set
                                  of intervals with the pattern for a
                                  particular raster line. There are always
                                  an even number of X coordinates. Lines
                                  are drawn from the starting point up to,
                                  but not including, the end point. Thus

                                  but not including, the end point. Thus
                                  X1-X2, X3-X4, are all lines drawn with
                                  the brush pointed to by lpPBrush, or by
                                  the pen pointed to by lpPPen if lpPBrush
                                  is NULL. This style can be used with
                                  memory bitmaps as well as on devices.
                                  The first point gives the Y coordinate
                                  of the scan. Each successive point is a
                                  pair of X values that determine the
                                  position and length of the scanline.

                                  information about the scanlines, such as
                                  the wCount and lpPoints parameters (as

                                  of the OS_ENDNSCAN style.

                                  These styles can be used to speed up the

                                  floodfills. The bracketing of the
                                  scanlines enables devices to set up the

                                  these styles will ignore them, and the
                                  scanline call will remain unchanged.

Style                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────



Output uses the current binary raster operation mode (ROP2) when drawing
lines and scanlines. It also uses the current background mode and color (if
it applies), but not the text color.

When drawing solid lines, Output replaces the destination pixel with a
combination of the destination and the line color. The binary raster
operation defines how the colors are combined. When drawing styled lines
(e.g., lines with gaps), the function replaces the destination pixels under
the solid part of the line with a combination of the destination and line
colors, the same as for a solid line. If the current background mode is
OPAQUE, Output replaces destination pixels under the gaps with a combination
of the pen and the current background color. Again, the raster operation
mode defines how to combine these colors. If the current background mode is
TRANSPARENT, Output leaves the destination pixels under the line gaps
unchanged. The same applies for hatched brushes. All the other pen and brush
styles are to be drawn OPAQUE regardless of the background mode. For
example, to draw a line that inverts the destination color, use the XOR
binary raster operation code and a white pen, or use the NOT binary raster
operation code and a black pen.

Output uses a brush pattern to draw scanlines. When drawing a scanline,
Output replaces the destination pixel color with a combination of the
destination color and the color of an individual pixel in the brush. The
binary raster operation code defines how the colors are to be combined. If
lpPBrush is NULL, the pen is used for the scanlines. A pen is considered to
be the same as a solid brush for this purpose. However, unlike a brush, it
cannot be dithered and should not be considered totally interchangeable with
a brush.

However, if there is no pen passed in the lpPPen field, then you use the
brush and draw the filling from the starting coordinate up to, but not
including, the last pixel. If there is a pen passed, then the border starts
on that first pixel, and you do not start drawing the fill until the second
pixel. You stop two pixels from the end because the border is the last one.


You should always stop drawing scanlines one pixel before the ending
coordinate. You do not draw through the last coordinate.

See also the discussion on patterned brushes under the RealizeObject()
function.

If a device registers in the GDIINFO data structure that it can do styled
polylines, then it must do them for all devices, no matter whether it is the
bitmap or the screen. It cannot fail them.

We recommend that you do not implement the OS_CIRCLE style (55). GDI will
always call the OS_ELLIPSE style (7) to draw a circle. Since there are no
efficiencies gained, there is no reason to support the circle style.


Pixel()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

Pixel (lpDestDev, wX, wY, dwPhysColor, lpDrawMode) : PhysColor

This function sets or retrieves the color of the specified pixel. If
lpDrawMode is not NULL, this function sets the given pixel to the color
given by dwPhysColor, using the binary raster operation given by lpDrawMode.
If lpDrawMode is NULL, the function returns the physical color of the pixel
given by wX and wY. (See the following Return Value section.)

RealizeObject()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

RealizeObject (lpDestDev, wStyle, lpInObj, lpOutObj, lpTextXForm) : wSize

This primitive directs the device driver to fill an attribute structure
created by GDI that will be used when drawing output primitives. It may also
direct the driver to return the size of such a structure.

If lpOutObj is a nonzero value, it is assumed to be a long pointer to a data
structure to be filled with the physical attributes of an object. wStyle
specifies the type of object to be realized and lpInObj is a long pointer to
a structure defining the logical attributes of the object. The function must
translate the logical attributes into sufficient information to accurately
describe a physical object for use by output functions when drawing. Only
the device driver uses the PPEN and PBRUSH objects (except that GDI also
uses the device fonts). Therefore, the format of these structures is up to
the device driver writer.

If lpOutObj is NULL, the function is expected to return the size (in bytes)
of the physical data structure. After receiving the object size, GDI
allocates space for the realized object and calls RealizeObject again,
passing a pointer to the allocated space in lpOutObj.

Return Value

If a device cannot realize an object, RealizeObject returns zero.


Comments

For further information on the TEXTXFORM data structure, see Chapter 13,
"The Font File Format," and Chapter 2, "Display Drivers."

When drawing operations are performed with a patterned brush created from a
monochrome bitmap, the 0 bits in the brush should be converted to the
current text color in the DRAWMODE structure that is passed to the drawing
function, and the 1 bits should be converted to the current background
color. Notice that these colors are not passed to RealizeObject() and may
change during the life of the brush.

Notice also that the colors used in hatch brushes or solid brushes are set
when the brush is realized (i.e., created) and do not change.

When realizing a hatch brush, the logicalBrush structure that is passed in
has the following form:

  logicalBrush struc
   lbStyle
   lbColor
   lbHatch
   lbBkColor
  logicalBrush ends

The lbColor and lbBkColor fields provide the colors that are used to draw
the foreground and the background. Notice also that lbColor is a logical
color and lbBkColor is a physical color.


SaveScreenBitmap()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

SaveScreenBitmap (lpRect, wCommand) : wSuccess

This function saves a single bitmap from the display or restores a single
(previously stored) bitmap to the display. It is used, for example, when a
menu is pulled down, to store the part of the screen that is "behind" the
menu until the menu is closed.

╓┌────────────────┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Parameter        Description
Parameter        Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpRect           A long pointer to the rectangle to use.
wCommand         0: Save the rectangle.
                 1: Restore it.
                 2: Discard previous save, if there was one.



Return Value

This function returns AX = 1 if successful, and AX = 0 for any of the
following error conditions:


  ■   "Shadow memory" does not exist (save, restore, ignore).

  ■   "Shadow memory" is already in use (save).

  ■   "Shadow memory" is not in use (restore).

  ■   "Shadow memory" has been stolen or trashed (restore).



Comments

Because SaveScreenBitmap can save only one bitmap at a time, the device
driver must maintain a record of whether or not the save area is currently
in use.

The bitmap is stored in "shadow memory" (i.e., memory for which the device
has control of allocation). Therefore, the device can save the bitmap in
whatever form is most convenient for it, without the rest of Windows
worrying about where it goes.


ScanLR()

Syntax

ScanLR (lpDestDev, wX, wY, dwPhysColor, Style) : wReturnVal

                                  dwPhysColor.

                                  If bit 1 is cleared, scan for a pixel with
                                  color that does not match.

                                  If bit 2 is set, scan to the left.

                                  If bit 2 is cleared, scan to the right.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────




Return Value

On return, AX holds the X coordinate of the first pixel satisfying the given
scan condition.

If either the given X or Y is not in the range of coordinates of the display
surface or the bitmap, then AX = 8000H.

If no pixel is found that satisfies the given scan condition, then AX = -1.

                                  CURSORSHAPE that specifies the appearance
                                  of the cursor for the specified device.




Return Value

None.


Comments

The cursor bitmap is actually two bitmaps. The first bitmap is ANDed with
the contents of the screen, and the second is XORed with the result. This
helps to preserve the appearance of the screen as the cursor is replaced and
ensures that at least some of the cursor is visible on all the potential
backgrounds.


StrBlt()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

StrBlt (lpDestDev, wDestXOrg, wDestYOrg, lpClipRect, lpString, wCount,
lpFontInfo, lpDrawMode, lpTextXForm): dwSuccess

This is an alternate entry point to ExtTextOut, which is provided for
compatibility with Windows 1.x.


Parameters

For Windows 2.0 and later versions, StrBlt should be implemented as a call
to ExtTextOut, in the following manner:

  cProc   StrBlt, &lt;FAR,PUBLIC&gt;,&lt;si, di&gt;
    parmd   lpDestDev
    parmw   DestXOrg
    parmw   DestYOrg
    parmd   lpClipRect
    parmd   lpString
    parmw   Count
    parmd   lpFontInfo
    parmd   lpDrawMode
    parmd   lpTextXForm
  cBegin  &lt;nogen&gt; ;don't fool with the stack frame
     ;until we get to ExtTextOut
  ;
  ;First, we must save our caller's far return address.
  ;Use CX &amp; BX for this.
  ;
  pop  cx  ;
  pop  bx  ;
  ;
  ;Now dummy up NULL parameters for the extra
  :parameters needed by ExtTextOut:
  ;
  xor   ax,ax ;
  push  ax ;push a dword for lpCharWidths
  push  ax ;
  push  ax ;push a dword for lpOpaqueRect
  push  ax ;
  push  ax ;push a word for Options
  push  bx ;push the caller's return address
  push  cx ;
  jmp  ExtTextOut   ;now go do the StrBlt using
     ;ExtTextOut!


Return Value

Under certain circumstances, (e.g., if the specified font is not supported),
StrBlt returns DX:AX = 8000:0000H to signify an error.

Otherwise, it returns DX:AX = 0000:0000H to signify success.

However, if wCount =&lt; 0, it returns DX:AX = Yext:Xext None


StretchBlt()
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

StretchBlt (lpPDevice, wDestX, wDestY, wDestXE, wDestYE, lpSrcPDevice,

Return Value

StretchBlt() returns a -1 if it cannot do the operation, and GDI will
simulate. It returns a 1 for success and a 0 for an unrecoverable error.


Comments

If the device cannot support a given call, it may fail (i.e., return a -1)
and GDI will perform the stretching. This allows devices to perform
stretching on cases that are supported but have GDI do the work on those
that are not. For example, if a device can stretch by integer factors, or
powers of two, it can use this capability.

If a device wants to support StretchBlt(), it must set the RC_STRETCHBLT bit
in the raster capabilities field in the GDIINFO structure.

The driver must export the StretchBlt() function with the ordinal number 27.


The StretchBltMode() function can be used for compression since this mode
specifies what to do with skipped scans. However, in Windows 3.0, there is
no access to StretchBltMode(). Therefore, when doing a StretchBlt() with a
monochrome destination, the device should assume COLORONCOLOR, and the call
should be failed (i.e., return a -1) so GDI will simulate the operation with
the proper StretchBltMode(). In Windows 3.1, there will be an
ExtendedDeviceMode() function that will make this mode available to the
driver.

Chapter 11  Device Driver Escapes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The device driver escapes enable applications and Microsoft Windows device
drivers to add support that is otherwise not available through the graphics
device interface's (GDI's) application program interface (API). Although
predefined escapes are useful for this purpose, they are not necessarily the
perfect solution. The more escapes we define and implement, the more code
you tend to include, which burdens the driver and application.

We recommend that all applications support all the escapes for changing
printer settings and any others for specialized support that are really
necessary.

Each device driver should support all the escapes that are possible for that
particular device. The device driver developer should recognize that an
application will assume that the printer setting escapes are available and
that it may request the more specialized escapes on high-end devices.


11.1  Introduction to Driver Escapes

GDI includes an entry point called Escape() that is used by applications to
perform a device-dependent operation that may or may not be supported on a
given device or that may be related to the job control of a printing
operation. GDI translates Escape() calls into calls to the device driver's
Control() function. GDI may perform its own interpretation of the escape if
it needs to. Therefore, there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence
between Escape() and Control() calls. However, the capabilities of these
calls are referred to on both sides as driver escapes.

The Control() function is required for all device drivers. However, you may
choose to support only a few of the escapes documented here or only the
minimal functionality required. For example, you can use QUERYESCSUPPORT to
tell the calling application that you support a subset or none of the
Control functions. Notice, though, that most of these escapes are applicable
only to printers. Most applications will not have to support calls to these
functions for display devices. In fact, the only escapes that are
recommended for support by display drivers are the following three:


  ■   QUERYESCSUPPORT

  ■   GETCOLORTABLE

  ■   SETCOLORTABLE (not for palette-capable devices)


The most common escapes used by all printing applications and printer
drivers are as follows:


  ■   QUERYESCSUPPORT

  ■   SETABORTPROC

  ■   STARTDOC

  ■   NEWFRAME

  ■   ENDDOC

  ■   ABORTDOC

  ■   NEXTBAND


The Control() function is declared for printers in C as follows:

  Int FAR PASCAL Control(
  PDEVICE FAR * lpPDevice,
  WORD  iFunction,
  LPSTR lpInData,
  LPSTR lpOutData
  );

Where:

lpPDevice points to a structure describing the physical device in use and is
defined by the device driver itself.

iFunction selects the specific escape function to be performed.

lpInData points to input data and lpOutData points to a buffer for output
data.

Although lpInData and lpOutData are declared as pointing to characters, they
generally point to some structure type. The precise type will depend on the
escape function selected.

The generalized stack frame to expect on a call to Control(), when using the
C macros in assembly language for display drivers, is as follows:

  cProc Control,&lt;FAR,PUBLIC&gt;,&lt;si,di&gt;
   parmD lpDestDev
   parmW SubFunction
   parmD lpInData
   parmD lpOutData


11.2  Generalized Error Return Codes

All the return codes are returned as signed integers in the AX register. The
following are the generalized return codes used by the printer driver
Control subfunctions. They are also referred to in this document by their
symbolic names. For all the Control subfunctions (i.e., escapes), a positive
number indicates success and a zero or negative return code indicates a
failure. It is best, however, to use the specific generalized error return
codes documented here whenever they are indicated as appropriate. Notice
that the Print Manager functions also return these same codes. When this
happens, the driver should return that error code to the caller of the
escape.

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SP_APPABORT (-2)                  The job was aborted because the
                                  application's
                                  callback returned false (0).

                                  Manager's "abort job" function.

SP_OUTOFDISK (-4)                 A lack of disk space caused the job to
                                  abort.

SP_OUTOFMEMORY (-5)               A lack of memory caused the job to abort.

ABORTDOC (Escape # 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, ABORTDOC, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape aborts the current job, erasing everything the application has
written to the device since the last ENDDOC escape.

The ABORTDOC escape should be used for printing operations that do not
specify an abort function (with the SETABORTPROC escape) and to terminate
printing operations that have not yet reached their first NEWFRAME or
NEXTBAND call.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpDevice                          A long pointer to a data structure of type
                                  PDEVICE, the destination device bitmap.

lpInData                          Not used.

Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

lpOutData                         Not used.




Return Value

The return value is positive if the function is successful; otherwise, it is
negative.


Comments

This escape is called by GDI when a banding error occurs. It is also called
by an application when an error occurs or when the application wants to
cancel the print job. The driver can delete the Print Manager job.

In some earlier printer drivers, this escape was called ABORTPIC.


BANDINFO (Escape # 24)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, BANDINFO, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape copies information about a device with banding capabilities to a
structure pointed at by lpIndata.

Banding is a property of an output device that allows a page of output to be
stored in a metafile and divided into bands, each of which is sent to the
device to create a complete page. Devices with banding capabilities avoid
problems associated with devices that cannot scroll backwards.

The information copied to the structure pointed at by lpIndata includes a
flag indicating whether or not there are graphics in the next band, a flag
indicating whether or not there is text on the page, and a rectangle
structure that contains a bounding rectangle for all graphics on the page.

╓┌──────────┌─────────────────────────────────┌──────────────────────────────►

                                             is zero.

           GraphicsRect                      RECT    Is a rectangle structure
                                             that contains the coordinates
                                             for a rectangle that bounds the
                                             graphics on the page.

           This data structure provides the
           primary communication between
           the driver and the application
           as to what (graphics and/or text)
           is actually on the page. See
           Section 5.5.5, "Using Banding
           Drivers," for a description of
           its use.

                                             zero.

           fTextFlag                         BOOL   Is non-zero if this is a
                                             text band; otherwise, it is zero

           GraphicsRect                      No valid return data.




Return Value

The return value is one if the escape function is successful; otherwise, it
is zero.


Comments

This escape should only be implemented for devices that use banding. It
should be called immediately after each call to the NEXTBAND escape.


BEGIN_PATH (Escape # 4096)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, BEGIN_PATH, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape opens a path. A path is a connected sequence of primitives drawn
in succession to form a single polyline or polygon. Paths enable
applications to draw complex borders, filled shapes, and clipping areas by
supplying a collection of other primitives defining the desired shape.

Printer escapes that support paths enable applications to render images on
sophisticated devices such as PostScript printers without generating huge
polygons to simulate them.

To draw a path, an application first issues the BEGIN_PATH escape. It then
draws the primitives defining the border of the desired shape and issues an
END_PATH and EXT_DEVICE_CAPS escapes. The END_PATH escape includes a
parameter specifying how the path is to be rendered.

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

This escape returns a short integer value specifying the current path
nesting level. If the escape is successful, the number of BEGIN_PATH calls
without a corresponding END_PATH call is the result. Otherwise, zero is the
result.


Comments

You may open a path within another path. A path drawn within another path is
treated exactly like a polygon (if the subpath is closed) or a polyline (if
the subpath is open).

You may use the CLIP_TO_PATH escape to define a clipping area corresponding
to the interior or exterior of the currently open path.

Device drivers that implement this escape must also implement the END_PATH
and EXT_DEVICE_CAPS escapes and should also implement the SET_ARC_DIRECTION
escape.


CLIP_TO_PATH (Escape # 4097)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, CLIP_TO_PATH, lpClipMode, lpOutData)

This escape defines a clipping area bounded by the currently open path. It
enables the application to save and restore the current clipping area and to
set up an inclusive or exclusive clipping area bounded by the currently open
path.

To clip a set of primitives against a path, an application should follow
these steps:


  1.  Save the current clipping area using the CLIP_TO_PATH escape.

  2.  Begin a path using the BEGIN_PATH escape.

  3.  Draw the primitives bounding the clipping area.

  4.  Close the path using the END_PATH escape.

  5.  Set the clipping area using the CLIP_TO_PATH escape.

  6.  Draw the primitives to be clipped.

  7.  Restore the original clipping area using the CLIP_TO_PATH escape.

Comments

Device drivers implementing the CLIP_TO_PATH escape must also implement the
BEGIN_PATH, END_PATH, and EXT_DEVICE_CAPS escapes and should also  implement
the SET_ARC_DIRECTION escape if they support elliptical arcs.


DRAFTMODE (Escape # 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, DRAFTMODE, lpDraftMode, lpOutData)

This escape turns draft mode off or on.

Turning draft mode on instructs the device driver to print faster and with
lower quality (if necessary). The draft mode can only be changed at page
boundaries, for example, after a NEWFRAME escape.

DRAWPATTERNRECT (Escape # 25)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, DRAWPATTERNRECT, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape creates a pattern, gray scale, or solid black rectangle using
the pattern/rule capabilities of PCL printers. With the HP LaserJet IIP,
this escape can also create a solid white rectangle. A gray scale is a gray
pattern that contains a specific mixture of black and white pixels. A PCL
printer is an HP LaserJet or LaserJet-compatible printer.

lpOutData  Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

The return value is non-zero if the escape function is successful;
otherwise, it is zero.


Comments

An application should use QUERYESCSUPPORT to determine whether or not a
device is capable of drawing patterns and rules before implementing this
escape. If a printer is capable of outputting a white rule, the return value
for QUERYESCSUPPORT is two.

The effect of a white rule is to erase any text or other pattern rules
already written in the specified area. For example, it is possible to draw a
large shaded area using prStyle = 1 and, then, print text in the erased
area.

The driver sends all text and rules in band1 before any GDI bitmap graphics
are sent. Therefore, it is not possible to erase bitmap graphics with white
rules.

If an application uses the BANDINFO escape, all patterns and rectangles sent
using DRAWPATTERNRECT should be enumerated as text and sent on a text band.


Patterns and rules created with this escape may not be erased by placing
opaque objects over them unless you have white rule capability. An
application should use the function calls provided in GDI to obtain this
effect.


ENABLEDUPLEX (Escape # 28)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, ENABLEDUPLEX, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape enables the duplex printing capability of a printer. A device
that has duplex printing capability is able to print on both sides of the
output medium.

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

The return value is one if the escape function is successful; otherwise, it
is zero.


Comments

An application should use the QUERYESCSUPPORT escape to determine whether or
not an output device is capable of creating duplex output. If
QUERYESCSUPPORT returns a nonzero value, the application should send the
ENABLEDUPLEX escape even if simplex printing is desired. This guarantees the
overriding of any values set in the driver-specific dialog. If duplex
printing is enabled and an uneven number of NEXTFRAME escapes is sent to the
driver prior to the ENDDOC escape, the driver will add one page eject before
ending the print job.


ENABLEPAIRKERNING (Escape # 769)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, ENABLEPAIRKERNING, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape enables or disables the driver's ability to kern character pairs
automatically. When it is enabled, the driver automatically kerns those
pairs of characters that are listed in the font's character-pair kerning
table. The driver reflects this kerning both on the printer and in
GetTextExtent calls.

                                  disabled (zero).

lpOutData                         A long pointer to a short integer variable
                                  that will receive the previous automatic
                                  pair-kerning flag.




Return Value

The return value is one if the function is successful; zero if not or if the
escape is not implemented.


Comments

The default state of this capability is zero; that is, automatic
character-pair kerning is disabled.

A driver does not have to support this escape just because it supplies the
character-pair kerning table to the application via the GETPAIRKERNTABLE
escape. When the GETPAIRKERNTABLE escape is supported but the
ENABLEPAIRKERNING escape is not, it is the application's responsibility to
space the kerned characters properly on the output device.


ENABLERELATIVEWIDTHS (Escape # 768)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, ENABLERELATIVEWIDTHS, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape enables or disables relative character widths. When it is
disabled (the default setting), each character's width can be expressed as
an integer number of device units. This guarantees that the extent of a
string will equal the sum of the extents of the characters in the string.
Such behavior enables applications to build an extent table manually using
one-character GetTextExtent calls. When it is enabled, the sum of a string
may or may not equal the sum of the widths of the characters. Applications
that enable this feature are expected to retrieve the font's extent table
and compute relatively-scaled string widths themselves.

                                  previous relative character-width flag.




Return Value

The return value is one if the function is successful; zero if not or if the
escape is not implemented.


Comments

The default state of this capability is zero; that is, relative character
widths are disabled.

Enabling this feature causes values that are specified as "font units" and
accepted and returned by the escapes described in this chapter to be
returned in the relative units of the font.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

It is assumed that only linear scaling devices will be dealt with in a
relative mode. Non-linear scaling devices should not implement this escape.

Comments

printing operation.


END_PATH (Escape # 4098)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, END_PATH, lpInfo, lpOutData)

This escape ends a path. A path is a connected sequence of primitives drawn
in succession to form a single polyline or polygon. Paths enable
applications to draw complex borders, filled shapes, and clipping areas by
supplying a collection of other primitives defining the desired shape.

Printer escapes supporting paths enable applications to render images on
sophisticated devices such as PostScript printers without generating huge
polygons to simulate them.

To draw a path, an application first issues the BEGIN_PATH escape. It then
draws the primitives defining the border of the desired shape and issues an
END_PATH escape.

The END_PATH escape takes as a parameter a pointer to a structure specifying
the manner in which the path is to be rendered. The structure specifies
whether or not the path is to be drawn and whether or not it is open or
closed. Open paths define polylines, and closed paths define fillable
polygons.

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

This escape returns a short integer value specifying the current path
nesting level. If the escape is successful, the number of BEGIN_PATH calls
without a corresponding END_PATH call is the result. Otherwise, -1 is the
result.


Comments

You may draw a path within another path. A path drawn within another path is
treated exactly like a polygon (if the subpath is closed) or a polyline (if
the subpath is open).

You may use the CLIP_TO_PATH escape to define a clipping area corresponding
to the interior or exterior of the currently open path.

Device drivers that implement this escape must also implement the BEGIN_PATH
and EXT_DEVICE_CAPS escapes and should also implement the SET_ARC_DIRECTION
escape.


ENUMPAPERBINS (Escape # 31)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, ENUMPAPERBINS, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape retrieves attribute information about a specified number of
paper bins. The GETSETPAPERBINS escape retrieves the number of bins
available on a printer. However, this escape is needed now only for backward
compatibility with earlier applications. You should now use the
ExtDeviceMode() driver function instead to acheive the same results.

                                  on the number of bins for which
                                  information was requested. See the

                                  description of this data structure.




Return Value

The return value specifies the outcome of the escape. It is one if the
escape is successful; it is zero if the escape is not successful or not
implemented.


Comments

The value pointed to by lpInData is an integer that specifies the number of
paper bins for which information is to be retrieved.

The lpOutData data structure consists of two arrays. The first is an array
of short integers containing the paper-bin identifier numbers in the
following format:

short BinList«cBinMax»

The number of integers in the array cBinMax is equal to the value pointed to
by the lpInData parameter.

The second array in the lpOutData structure is a ragged array of characters
in the following format:

char PaperNames«cBinMax»«cchBinName»

The cBinMax value is equal to the value pointed to by the lpInData
parameter; the cchBinName value is the length of each string (currently 24).



ENUMPAPERMETRICS (Escape # 34)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, ENUMPAPERMETRICS, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape performs one of two jobs according to the mode. The first is to
determine the number of paper types supported and return this value, which
can then be used to allocate an array of RECTs. However, this escape is
needed now only for backward compatibility with earlier applications. You
should now use the ExtDeviceMode() driver function instead to acheive the
same results.

These RECTs get filled in with the coordinates of the imageable area during
a second call. That is, for example:

  top =  cyMargin
  left =  cxMargin
  right =  cxPage + cxMargin
  bottom =  cyPage + cyMargin

Where: The units are device coordinates. The orientation returned is always
portrait. For every supported paper type, the imageable area for each margin
state is returned.

EPSPRINTING (Escape # 33)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, EPSPRINTING, lpBool, lpOutData)

This escape only controls the downloading of the control portions of the
PostScript prolog. It sets up the portrait versus landscape orientation and
leaves the printer in the default 72 dpi user space.

Return Value

This escape returns a nonzero value if the specified extended capability is
supported and a zero if it is not.

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

The return value is positive if the function is successful; otherwise, it is
negative.


Comments

This escape is intended for banding printer drivers. When called, they
should reinitialize the banding bitmap (i.e., eliminate anything in the
bitmap that is only partially drawn).


GETCOLORTABLE (Escape # 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, GETCOLORTABLE, lpIndex, lpColor)

This escape retrieves an RGB color-table entry and copies it to the location
specified by lpColor.

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpDevice                          A long pointer to a data structure of type
                                  PDEVICE, which is the destination device
                                  bitmap.

lpIndex                           A 32-bit address to a short integer value
                                  specifying the index of a color-table
                                  entry. Color-table indices start at zero
                                  for the first table entry.

lpColor                           A 32-bit address to the long integer to
                                  receive the RGB color value for the given
                                  entry.




Return Value

The return value is positive if the function is successful; otherwise, it is
negative.


Comments

Display drivers will probably want to support this escape. It returns RGB
colors that are mapped to the physical-color index passed in.


GETEXTENDEDTEXTMETRICS (Escape # 256)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, GETEXTENDEDTEXTMETRICS, lpInData, lpOutData)

                                  escape.




Return Value

The return value is the number of KERNPAIR structures copied to the buffer.
This value is zero if the font does not have kerning pairs defined, the
function fails, or the escape is not implemented.


Comments

The values returned in the KERNPAIR structures are affected by whether
relative character widths are enabled or disabled. See also the
ENABLERELATIVEWIDTHS escape.

The KERNPAIR data structure has the following format:

  typedef struc {

negative.


GETPRINTINGOFFSET (Escape # 13)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, GETPRINTINGOFFSET, lpInData, lpOffset)

This escape retrieves the offset from location 0,0 (the upper-left corner of
the physical page), the point at which the actual printing or drawing
begins.

This escape function is not generally useful for devices that allow the user
to set the printable origin by hand.

negative.


GETSCALINGFACTOR (Escape # 14)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, GETSCALINGFACTOR, lpInData, lpFactors)

This escape retrieves the scaling factors for the x and y axes of a printing
device. For each scaling factor, the escape copies an exponent of two to the
location pointed to by lpFactors.

For example, the value 3 is copied to lpFactors for a scaling factor of 8.

Scaling factors are used by printing devices that cannot support graphics at
the same resolution as the device resolution. This escape communicates to
GDI the factor by which it needs to stretch bitmaps when drawing them to the
printer.

╓┌──────────┌─────────────────────────────────┌──────────────────────────────►

negative.


GETSETPAPERBINS (Escape # 29)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, GETSETPAPERBINS, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape retrieves the number of paper bins available on a printer and
sets the current paper bin. See the following Comments section for more
information on the actions performed by this escape.

                                  that contains information about the
                                  current or previous paper bin and the
                                  number of bins available. This data
                                  structure may be set to NULL.




Return Value

The return value specifies whether or not the requested operation was
successful.


Comments

There are three possible actions for this escape, depending on the value of
the values passed in the lpInData and lpOutData parameters:

╓┌─────────┌──────────┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────►
lpInData  lpOutData  Action
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NULL      BININFO    Retrieves the number of bins and the number of the
                     current bin.

BININFO   BININFO    Sets the current bin to the number specified in the
                     BinNumber field of the lpInData data structure and
                     retrieves the number of the previous bin.

BININFO   NULL       Sets the current bin to the number specified in the
                     BinNumber field of the lpInData data structure.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────



The BININFO data structure has the following format:

  short   BinNumber;
  short   NbrofBins;
  short   Reserved;
  short   Reserved;
  short   Reserved;
  short   Reserved;

The BININFO data structure has the following fields:

╓┌───────────────┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Field           Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
BinNumber       Identifies the current or previous paper bin.
NbrofBins       Specifies the number of paper bins available.


When setting the paper bin with GETSETPAPERBINS, the bin selected is set for
the current job by setting the MSB (0x8000) of the bin index. If this bit is
not set, the selected paper bin is made the default for later print jobs,
and the current job's selection is unchanged. Setting bit 15 enables an
application to change bins in mid-job.

This escape was supported in version 3.1 of the PCL and PostScript drivers.
However, it did not allow the setting of the current bin, only the default.
GETSETPAPERBINS will return an error if the high bit is set on this version
of the drivers, which allows the application to determine whether or not the
older driver version is in use.

This escape was inconsistently numbered as 30 in the Windows 2.1 PCL driver
and as 29 in the PostScript driver. This has now been corrected, and the
numbering is consistent with this document.


GETSETPAPERMETRICS (Escape # 35)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, GETSETPAPERMETRICS, lpNewPaper, lpOrigPaper)

This escape sets the paper type according to the given paper-metrics
information. It also gets the current printer's paper-metrics information.
However, this escape is needed now only for backward compatibility with
earlier applications. You should now use the ExtDeviceMode() driver function
instead to acheive the same results.

This escape expects a RECT data structure, representing the imageable area
of the physical page, and assumes the origin is in the upper-left corner.
That is, for example,

  top =  cyMargin
  left =  cxMargin
  right =  cxPage + cxMargin
  bottom =  cyPage + cyMargin

Where: The units expected and returned are coordinates in device units. The
orientation is set to match that of the input RECT. The margin state is set.

Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpDevice                          A long pointer to a data structure of type
                                  PDEVICE, which is the destination device
                                  bitmap.

lpNewPaper                        A long pointer to a RECT data structure
                                  that points to the new imageable area.

lpOrigPaper                       A long pointer to a RECT data structure
                                  that points to the original value.




Return Value

It is positive if successful, zero if the escape is not implemented, and
negative if an error occurs.


Comments

The following is an example of code:

  #define  GETSETPAPERMETRICS (35)
  int result;
  HANDLE  hDCPrinter;
  RECT newpaper, origpaper;

GETSETPRINTORIENT (Escape # 30)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, GETSETPRINTORIENT, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape returns or sets the current paper orientation. However, this
escape is needed now only for backward compatibility with earlier
applications. You should now use the ExtDeviceMode() driver function instead
to acheive the same results.

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpDevice                          A long pointer to a data structure of type
                                  PDEVICE, which is the destination device
                                  bitmap.

lpInData                          A long pointer to an ORIENT data structure
                                  that specifies the new paper orientation.
                                  See the following Comments section for a
                                  description of this data structure. When
                                  it is set to NULL, the GETSETPRINTORIENT
                                  escape returns the current paper
                                  orientation.

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

The return value specifies the current orientation if lpInData is NULL;
otherwise, it is the previous orientation or -1 if the escape failed.


Comments

The ORIENT data structure has the following format:

  short  Orientation;
  short  Reserved;
  short  Reserved;
  short  Reserved;
  short  Reserved;

If Orientation is 1, the new orientation is portrait; if 2, the new
orientation is landscape.

The new orientation will take effect for the next device context created for
the device on this port.

This escape is also known as GETSETPAPERORIENTATION.

This escape was inconsistently numbered as 29 in the Windows 2.1 PCL driver
and as 30 in the PostScript driver. This has now been corrected, and the
numbering is consistent with this document.


GETTECHNOLOGY (Escape # 20)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

                                  technology type, such as "PostScript."




Return Value

The return value specifies the outcome of the escape. It is one if the
escape is successful and zero if the escape is not successful or not
implemented.


GETTRACKKERNTABLE (Escape # 259)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

                                  by the GETEX-
                                  TENDEDTEXTMETRICS escape. If lpOutData is
                                  NULL, GETTRACKKERNTABLE returns the number
                                  of table entries.




Return Value

The return value is the number of KERNTRACK structures copied to the buffer.
This value is zero if the font does not have kerning tracks defined, if the
function fails, or if the escape is not implemented.


Comments

The values returned in the KERNTRACK structures are affected by whether
relative character widths are enabled or disabled. See also the
ENABLERELATIVEWIDTHS escape.

The KERNTRACK data structure has the following format:

  typedef struc {

GETVECTORBRUSHSIZE (Escape # 27)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, GETVECTORBRUSHSIZE, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape retrieves the size in device units of a plotter pen used to fill
closed figures. GDI uses this information to prevent the filling of closed
figures (e.g., rectangles and ellipses) from overwriting the borders of the

NEWFRAME (Escape # 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, NEWFRAME, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape informs the device that the application has finished writing to
a page.

This escape is used typically with a printer to direct the device driver to
advance to a new page by performing a page-break algorithm or form feed.

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

The return value is positive if the escape is successful. Otherwise, it is
one of the values documented in Section 11.2, "Generalized Error Return
Codes."


Comments

If you select a font into your printer device context (DC), print some text,
and then issue a NEWFRAME, the next page of text is printed using the
default font. What happens is that NEWFRAME saves the DC and, then, restores
it with the default values. Therefore, you will have to reselect your font
after each new page on banding devices.


NEXTBAND (Escape # 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, NEXTBAND, lpInData, lpBandRect)

This escape informs the device driver that the application has finished
writing to a band. This causes the device driver to send the band to the
printer and return the coordinates of the next band.

This escape is used by applications that handle banding themselves.

                                  graphics coordinates.

lpBandRect                        The return value is a 32-bit address to
                                  the RECT data structure to receive the
                                  next band coordinates. The device driver
                                  copies the device coordinates of the next
                                  band into this structure.




Return Value

The return value is positive if the escape is successful. Otherwise, it is
one of the values documented in Section 11.2, "Generalized Error Return
Codes."


Comments

This escape is intended mainly for banding printers.

The shift count mentioned in lpInData is used for devices such as laser
printers that support graphics at a lower resolution than text. The x
coordinate specifies the X scale count and the y coordinate the Y scale
count.


PASSTHROUGH (Escape #19)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, PASSTHROUGH, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape enables the application to send data directly to the printer,
bypassing the standard printer-driver code.

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►

                                  bitmap.

lpInData                          Points to a structure, the first WORD of
                                  which contains the number of bytes of
                                  input data. The remaining bytes of the
                                  structure contain the data itself.

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

This is the number of bytes transferred to the printer if the function is
successful; it is zero if the function is not successful or if the escape is
not implemented. If the returned value is nonzero but less than the size of
the data, an error prohibited transmission of the entire data block.


Comments

There may be restrictions on the kinds of device data an application may
send to the device without interfering with the operation of the driver. In
general, applications must avoid resetting the printer or causing the page
to be printed. Additionally, applications are strongly discouraged from
performing functions that consume printer memory, such as downloading a font
or a macro.

The driver should invalidate its internal state variables such as "current
position" and "current line style" when executing this escape. The driver
may issue a printer "save" command prior to transmitting the first of a
sequence of PASSTHROUGH escapes and issue a "restore" command prior to
executing the first command after the last PASSTHROUGH escape. In other
words, the application must be able to issue multiple, sequential
PASSTHROUGH escapes without intervening "saves" and "restores" being
inserted by the driver.

This escape is also known as DEVICEDATA.


QUERYESCSUPPORT (Escape # 8)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, QUERYESCSUPPORT, lpEscNum, lpOutData)

This escape finds out whether or not a particular escape function is
implemented by the device driver.

The return value is non-zero for implemented escape functions and zero for
unimplemented escape functions. All device drivers must return success if
queried about whether they support the QUERYESCSUPPORT escape.

                                  function to be checked.

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

The return value is non-zero for implemented escape functions; otherwise, it
is zero.


RESTORE_CTM (Escape # 4100)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, RESTORE_CTM, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape restores the previously saved current transformation matrix
(CTM). The current transformation matrix controls the manner in which
coordinates are translated, rotated, and scaled by the device. By using
matrices, you can combine these operations in any order to produce the
desired mapping for a particular picture.

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

This escape returns a short integer specifying the number of SAVE_CTM calls
without a corresponding RESTORE_CTM call. If the escape is unsuccessful, -1
is returned as a result.


Comments

Applications should not make any assumptions about the initial contents of
the current transformation matrix.

When a driver transforms a primitive using a transformation matrix modified
by the application, it should ignore the clipping rectangle specified by
GDI. Applications should specify the desired clipping rectangle using the
SET_CLIP_BOX escape.

Drivers supporting this escape must also implement the SET_CLIP_BOX,
SAVE_CTM, and TRANSFORM_CTM escapes.

The matrix specification used for this escape is based on the OS/2 GPI
(Graphics Programming Interface) model, which is an integer coordinate
system similar to the one used by GDI.


SAVE_CTM (Escape # 4101)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SAVE_CTM, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape saves the current transformation matrix (CTM). The current
transformation matrix controls the manner in which coordinates are
translated, rotated, and scaled by the device. By using matrices, you can
combine these operations in any order to produce the desired mapping for a
particular picture.

You can restore the matrix by using the RESTORE_CTM escape.

An application typically saves the current transformation matrix before
changing it. This enables the application to restore the previous state upon
completion of a particular operation.

Return Value

This escape returns a short integer specifying the number of SAVE_CTM calls
without a corresponding RESTORE_CTM call. If the escape is unsuccessful,
zero is returned.


Comments

Applications should not make any assumptions about the initial contents of
the current transformation matrix.

Applications are expected to restore the contents of the current
transformation matrix.

When a driver transforms a primitive using a transformation matrix modified
by the application, it should ignore the clipping rectangle specified by
GDI. Applications should specify the desired clipping rectangle using the
SET_CLIP_BOX escape.

Drivers supporting this escape must also implement the SET_CLIP_BOX,
RESTORE_ CTM, and TRANSFORM_CTM escapes.

The matrix specification used for this escape is based on the OS/2 GPI
(Graphics Programming Interface) model, which is an integer coordinate
system similar to the one used by GDI.


SELECTPAPERSOURCE (Escape # 18)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This is an older escape and is no longer used. It has been superceded by
GETSETPAPERBINS.

It enabled the application to determine the available paper sources, select
among them, and pass the desired paper source to the device driver.


SETABORTPROC (Escape # 9)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SETABORTPROC, lphDC, lpOutData)

This escape sets the abort function for the print job.

If an application wants to allow the print job to be cancelled during
spooling, it must set the abort function before the print job is started
with the STARTDOC escape. Print Manager calls the abort function during
spooling to allow the application to cancel the print job or to handle
out-of-disk-space conditions. If no abort function is set, the print job
will fail if there is not enough disk space for spooling.

The lphDC parameter points to the application hDC which is to be passed to
the OpenJob function to allow GDI to call the application's callback
function.


SETALLJUSTVALUES (Escape # 771)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SETALLJUSTVALUES, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape sets all the text justification values that are used for text
output. Text justification is the process of inserting extra pixels among
break characters in a line of text. The blank character is normally used as
a break character.

Parameter  Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpOutData  Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

The return value is one if the escape function is successful; otherwise, it
is zero.


Comments

The units used for nCharExtra and nBreakExtra are the font units of the
device (see the EXTTEXTMETRIC escape) and are dependent on whether or not
relative character widths were enabled with the ENABLERELATIVEWIDTHS escape.


The values set with this escape will apply to subsequent calls to
ExtTextOut. The driver will stop distributing the nCharExtra amount when it
has output nCharCount characters. It will also stop distributing the space
specified by nBreakExtra when it has output nBreakCount characters. A call
on the same string to GetTextExtent, made immediately after the ExtTextOut
call, is processed in the same manner.

To reenable justification with the SetTextJustification and
SetTextCharacterExtra functions, an application should call SETALLJUSTVALUES
and set the arguments nCharExtra and nBreakExtra to zero.


SET_ARC_DIRECTION (Escape # 4102)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SET_ARC_DIRECTION, lpDirection, lpOutData)

This escape specifies the direction in which elliptical arcs are drawn using
the GDI arc function.

By convention, elliptical arcs are drawn counterclockwise by GDI. This
escape enables an application to draw paths containing arcs drawn clockwise.

                                  specifying the arc direction. It may be
                                  either COUNTERCLOCKWISE(0) or CLOCKWISE(1).

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

This escape returns the previous arc direction.


Comments

The default arc direction is COUNTERCLOCKWISE.

Device drivers that implement the BEGIN_PATH and END_PATH escapes should
also implement this escape.

This escape maps to PostScript language elements and is intended for
PostScript line devices.


SET_BACKGROUND_COLOR (Escape # 4103)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SET_BACKGROUND_COLOR, lpNewColor, lpOldColor)

This escape enables an application to set and retrieve the current
background color for the device. The background color is the color of the
display surface before an application draws anything on the device. This
escape is particularly useful for color printers and film recorders.

This escape should be sent before the application draws anything on the
current page.

                                  be copied. This parameter can be NULL if
                                  the application wants to ignore the
                                  previous background color.




Return Value

This escape returns TRUE if the escape is successful and FALSE if it is
unsuccessful.


Comments

The default background color is white.

The background color is reset to the default when the device driver receives
an ENDDOC or ABORTDOC escape.


SET_BOUNDS (Escape # 4109)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SET_BOUNDS, lpBounds, lpOutData)

This escape sets the bounding rectangle for the picture being output by the
device driver that supports the given device context. It is used when
creating images in a file format such as Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) and
Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language (HPGL) for which there is a device driver.

lpBounds                          A long pointer to a rectangle, specified
                                  in device coordinates, that bounds the
                                  image to be output.

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

This escape returns TRUE if successful; otherwise, it returns FALSE.


Comments

The application should issue this escape before each page in the image. For
single-page images, this escape should be issued immediately after the
STARTDOC escape.

When using coordinate transformation escapes, device drivers may not perform
bounding-box calculations correctly. Using this escape saves the driver from
the task of calculating the bounding box.

Applications that want to support the EPS printing capabilities that will be
built into future PostScript drivers should always issue this escape.


SET_CLIP_BOX (Escape # 4108)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SET_CLIP_BOX, lpClipBox, lpOutdata)

This escape sets the clipping rectangle or restores the previous clipping
rectangle. The SET_CLIP_BOX escape is required of any device driver that
implements the coordinate transformation escapes.

When an applications calls a GDI output function, GDI calculates a clipping
rectangle that bounds the primitive and, then, passes both the primitive and
the clipping rectangle on to the driver. The driver is expected to clip the
primitive to the specified bounding rectangle.

However, when an application uses the coordinate transformation escapes, the
clipping rectangle that was calculated by GDI is generally invalid. The
application can use the SET_CLIP_BOX escape to specify the correct clipping
rectangle when coordinate transformations are used.

Return Value

This escape returns a Boolean value specifying whether or not the clipping
rectangle was set properly.

must also implement this escape.


SETCOLORTABLE (Escape # 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SETCOLORTABLE, lpColorEntry, lpColor)

This escape sets an RGB color table entry.

If the device cannot supply the exact color, the function sets the entry to
the closest possible approximation of the color.

              color value selected by the
              device driver to represent the
              requested color value.




Return Value

The return value is positive if the function is successful; otherwise, it is
negative.


Comments

A device's color table is a shared resource; changing the system display
color for one window changes it for all the windows.

The SETCOLORTABLE escape has no effect on devices with fixed color tables.

This escape is intended for use by both printer and display drivers.
However, the EGA and VGA color drivers do not support it. It should not be
used with palette-capable display devices.

It is used by applications that want to change the palette used by the
display driver. However, since the driver's color-mapping algorithms will
probably no longer work with a different palette, an extension has been
added to this function.

If the color index pointed to by lpColorEntry is FFFFH, the driver is to
leave all colormapping functionality to the calling application. The
application will necessarily know the proper color-mapping algorithm and
take responsibility for passing the correctly mapped physical color to the
driver (instead of the logical RGB color) in functions such as RealizeObject
and ColorInfo.

For example, if the device supports 256 colors with palette indices of 0
through 255, the application would determine which index contains the color
that it wants to use in a certain brush. It would then pass this index in
the low byte of the doubleword logical color passed into RealizeObject. The
driver would then use this color exactly as passed instead of performing its
usual color-mapping algorithm. If the application wants to reactivate the
driver's color-mapping algorithm (i.e., if it restores the original palette
when switching from its window context), then the color index pointed to by
lpColorEntry should be FFFEH.


SETCOPYCOUNT (Escape # 17)

SETKERNTRACK (Escape # 770)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SETKERNTRACK, lpInData, lpOutData)

For drivers that support automatic track kerning, this escape specifies
which kerning track will be used. A kerning track of zero disables automatic
track kerning. When this escape is enabled, the driver automatically kerns
all characters according to the specified track. The driver reflects this
kerning both on the printer and in GetTextExtent calls.

Return Value

The return value is one if the escape is successful and zero if it is not or
if the escape is not implemented.


Comments

The default state of this capability is zero, which means that automatic
track kerning is disabled.

A driver does not have to support this escape just because it supplies the
track-kerning table to the application using the GETTRACKKERNTABLE escape.
In the case where GETTRACKKERNTABLE is supported but SETKERNTRACK is not, it
is the application's responsibility to properly space the characters on the
output device.

           -1                                Line segments are drawn by using
                                             the default GDI end cap.

           0                                 Line segments are drawn with a
                                             squared end point that does not
                                             project past the specified
                                             segment length.

           1                                 Line segments are drawn with a
                                             rounded end point; the diameter
                                             of this semicircular arc is
                                             equal to the line width.

           2                                 Line segments are drawn with a
                                             squared end point that projects
                                             past the specified segment
                                             length. The projection is equal
                                             to half the line width.

lpOutData  A long pointer to a short
           integer value that specifies the
           previous end-cap setting.




Return Value

The return value specifies the outcome of the escape. It is positive if the
escape is successful; otherwise, it is negative.

The interpretation of this escape varies with page-description languages
(PDLs). Consult your PDL documentation for its exact meaning.

This escape is also known as SETENDCAP.


SETLINEJOIN (Escape # 22)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SETLINEJOIN, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape is used to tell the driver how an application wants to join two
lines at an angle. It sets the current line join parameter in the graphics
state to int, which must be one of the following integers: 0 (for Miter
Join), 1 (for Round Join), or 2 (for Bevel Join).

                                  driver should use this value. If NULL,
                                  then the line join value is not changed.

lpOutData                         If not NULL, a long pointer to a
                                  WORD-length value in which the previous
                                  (or current if lpInData is NULL) line join
                                  value should be returned.




Return Value

The return value is TRUE (1) if the escape is successful.


Comments

Join styles are significant only at points at which consecutive segments of
a path connect at an angle; segments that meet or intersect fortuitously
receive no special treatment. Curved lines are actually rendered as
sequences of straight line segments, and the current line join is applied to
the "corners" between those segments. However, for typical values of the
flatness parameter, the corners are so shallow that the difference between
join styles is not visible. The following are the three possible line join
styles:

Miter Join (0): The outer edges of the strokes for the two segments are
extended until they meet at an angle, as in a picture frame. (If the
segments meet at too sharp of an angle, a Bevel Join is used instead; this
is controlled by the miter limit parameter established by SETMITERLIMIT.)

Round Join (1): A circular arc with a diameter equal to the line width is
drawn around the point where the segments meet, and is filled in, producing
a rounded corner. (The stroke actually draws a full circle at this point. If
path segments shorter than one-half the line width meet at sharp angles, an
unintentional "wrong side" of this circle may appear.)

Bevel Join (2): The meeting path segments are finished with butt end caps
(see the SETLINECAP escape); then, the resulting notch beyond the ends of
the segments is filled with a triangle.


SET_MIRROR_MODE (Escape # 4110)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SET_MIRROR_MODE, lpMirrorMode, lpOutdata)

This escape sets the current mirror mode, which is used to produce mirror
images along either the horizontal or vertical axes.

To produce a mirror image of a given page, the application issues the
SET_MIRROR_ MODE escape before drawing the first primitive to be mirrored.
When the last mirrored primitive has been drawn, the application issues a
second SET_MIRROR_MODE escape to turn off mirroring.

lpMirrorMode  A long pointer to a short
              integer that specifies the
              mirror mode, which may be one
              of the following values:

              Notice that MIRROR_BOTH is
              obtained by OR'ing together
              MIRROR_HORIZONTAL and
              MIRROR_VERTICAL.

lpOutData     Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

This escape returns the previous mirror mode.


Comments

The default mirror mode is MIRROR_NONE.

Mirrored and unmirrored output can be mixed on a page. This enables the
application to produce mirrored output with such things as unmirrored page
labels and crop marks.


SETMITERLIMIT (Escape # 23)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SETMITERLIMIT, lpInData, lpOutData)

This escape is used to tell the driver how an application wants to clip off
miter-type line joins when they become too long. It sets the current
miter-limit parameter in the graphics state to num, which must be a number
greater than or equal to one.

                                  then the miter-limit value is not changed.

lpOutData                         If not NULL, a long pointer to a
                                  WORD-length value in which the previous

                                  miter-limit value should
                                  be returned.




Return Value

The return value is TRUE (1) if the escape is successful.


Comments

The miter limit controls the stroke operator's treatment of corners when
miter joins have been specified (see the SETLINEJOIN escape). When path
segments connect at a sharp angle, a miter join results in a spike that
extends well beyond the connection point. The purpose of the miter limit is
to cut off such spikes when they become objectionably long.

At any given corner, the miter length is the distance from the point at
which the inner edges of the strokes intersect to the point at which the
outside edges of the strokes intersect (i.e., the diagonal length of the
miter). This distance increases as the angle between the segments decreases.
If the ratio of the miter length to the line width exceeds the miter-limit
parameter, the corner is treated with a Bevel Join instead of a Miter Join.


The ratio of miter length to line width is directly related to the angle
(x?) between the segments by the formula:

    miter length / line width = 1 / sin(x?/2)

The following are examples of miter-limit values:


  ■   1.415 cuts off miters (converts them to bevels) at angles less than 90
      degrees.

  ■   2.0 cuts off miters at angles less than 60 degrees.

  ■   10.0 cuts off miters at angles less than 11 degrees.


The default value of the miter limit is 10. Setting the miter limit to 1
cuts off miters at all angles so that bevels are always produced even when
miters are specified.


SET_POLY_MODE (Escape # 4104)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SET_POLY_MODE, lpMode, lpOutData)

This escape enables a device driver to draw shapes (such as Bezier curves)
that are not supported directly by GDI. This permits applications that draw
complex curves to send the curve description directly to a device without
having to simulate the curve as a polygon with a large number of points.

The SET_POLY_MODE escape sets the poly mode for the device driver. The poly
mode is a state variable indicating how to interpret calls to the GDI
functions Polygon and Polyline.

                                  interpreted. The device driver need not
                                  support all the possible modes. It is
                                  expected to return zero if it does not
                                  support the specified mode. The mode
                                  parameter may be one of the following:

                                  the sequence has the end point of the
                                  previous curve as its start point, the
                                  next two points as control points, and the
                                  third as its end point.

                                  The last curve in the sequence is
                                  permitted to have fewer than four points.
                                  If the curve has only one point, it is
                                  considered a point. If it has two points,
                                  it is a line segment. If it has three
                                  points, it is a parabola defined by
                                  drawing a Bezier curve with the end points

                                  are drawn connecting each successive pair
                                  of points.

                                  PM_POLYSCANLINE. The points specify a list
                                  of coordinate pairs. Line segments are
                                  drawn connecting each successive pair of
                                  points. Each line segment is a
                                  nominal-width line drawn using the current
                                  brush. Each line segment must be strictly

                                  be passed strictly in increasing or
                                  decreasing order. This mode is used only
                                  for Polygon calls.

Return Value

This escape returns the previous poly mode. If the return value is zero, the
device driver is assumed not to have handled the request.


Comments

An application should issue the SET_POLY_MODE escape before it draws a
complex curve. It should then call Polyline or Polygon with the desired
control points defining the curve. After drawing the curve, the application
should reset the driver to its previous state by reissuing the SET_POLY_MODE
escape.

Polyline calls are drawn using the currently selected pen.

Polygon calls are drawn using the currently selected pen and brush. If the
start and end points are not equal, a line is drawn from the start point to
the end point before filling the polygon (or curve).

Polygon calls using PM_POLYLINESEGMENT mode are treated exactly the same as
Polyline calls.

A Bezier curve is defined by four points. The curve is generated by
connecting the first and second, second and third, and third and fourth
points. The midpoints of these consecutive line segments are then connected.
Then the midpoints of the lines connecting the midpoints are connected, and
so forth as shown in Figure 11.1.

(This figure may be found in the printed book).

The line segments drawn in this way converge to a curve defined by the
following parametric equations, expressed as a function of an independent
variable t.

X(t) = (1-t)3x1 + 3(1-t)2tx2 + 3(1-t)t2x3 + t3x4

Y(t) = (1-t)3y1 + 3(1-t)2ty2 + 3(1-t)t2y3 + t3y4

The points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), and (x4,y4) are the control points
defining the curve. The independent variable t varies from 0 to 1.

A second-degree Bezier curve may be expressed as a third-degree Bezier using
the parameterization shown in Figure 11.2.

(This figure may be found in the printed book).

And where (Cx1, Cy1) and (Cx2, Cy2) are third-degree control points of the
second-degree Bezier specified by the points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3,
y3).

The supported poly modes are defined as follows:

PM_POLYLINE                       1

PM_BEZIER                         2

PM_POLYLINESEGMENT                3

Additional primitive types (other than PM_BEZIER and PM_POLYLINESEGMENT) may
be added to this escape in the future. Applications are expected to check
the return value from this escape to determine whether or not the driver
supports the specified poly mode.


SET_SCREEN_ANGLE (Escape # 4105)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SET_SCREEN_ANGLE, lpAngle, lpOutData)

Four-color process separation is the process of separating the colors
comprising an image into four component primaries: cyan, magenta, yellow,
and black. The image is then reproduced by overprinting each primary.

In traditional four-color process printing, half-tone images for each of the
four primaries are photographed against a mask tilted to a particular angle.
Tilting the mask in this manner minimizes unwanted moire patterns caused by
overprinting two or more colors. The SET_SCREEN_ANGLE escape sets the
current screen angle to the desired angle and enables an application to
simulate the tilting of a photographic mask in producing a separation for a
particular primary.

SET_SPREAD (Escape # 4106)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, SET_SPREAD, lpSpread, lpOutData)

Spot color separation is the process of separating an image into each
distinct color used in the image. You then reproduce the image by
overprinting each successive color in the image.

When reproducing a spot-separated image, the printing equipment must be
calibrated to align each page exactly on each pass. However, differences
between passes in such factors as temperature and humidity often cause
images to align imperfectly on subsequent passes. For this reason, lines in
spot separations are often widened (spread) slightly to make up for problems
in registering subsequent passes through the printer.

This process, called trapping, is implemented by the SET_SPREAD escape,
which sets the spread for the given device. The spread is the amount by
which all the non-white primitives are expanded to provide a slight overlap
between primitives to compensate for imperfections in the reproduction
process.

lpDevice                          A long pointer to a data structure of type
                                  PDEVICE, which is the destination device
                                  bitmap.

lpSpread                          A long pointer to a short integer
                                  specifying the amount, in device
                                  pixels, by which all the non-white
                                  primitives are to be expanded.

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

This escape returns the previous spread.


Comments

The default spread is zero.

The current spread applies to all the bordered primitives (whether or not
the border is visible) and text.


STARTDOC (Escape # 10)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, STARTDOC, lpDocName, lpOutData)

This escape informs the device driver that a new print job is starting and
that all subsequent NEWFRAME calls should be spooled under the same job,
until an ENDDOC call occurs.

This ensures that documents longer than one page will not be interspersed
with other jobs.

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpDevice                          A long pointer to a data structure of type
                                  PDEVICE, which is the destination device
                                  bitmap.

lpDocName                         A 32-bit address to a NULL-terminated
                                  string specifying the name of the document.
                                  The document name is displayed in the
                                  Print Manager window.

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

The return value is -1 if an error occurs, such as insufficient memory or an
invalid port specification. Otherwise, it is positive.


Comments

The correct sequence of events in a printing operation is as follows:


  1.  Create printer device context.

  2.  Set the abort function to keep out-of-disk-space errors from aborting
      a printing operation. An abort procedure that handles these errors
      must be set using the SETABORTPROC escape.

  3.  Begin the printing operation with STARTDOC.

  4.  End each new page with NEWFRAME or begin each new band with NEXTBAND.

  5.  End the printing operation with ENDDOC.



TRANSFORM_CTM (Escape # 4107)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Syntax

short Control (lpDevice, TRANSFORM_CTM, lpMatrix, lpOutData)

This escape modifies the current transformation matrix (CTM). The current
transformation matrix controls the manner in which coordinates are
translated, rotated, and scaled by the device. By using matrices, you can
combine these operations in any order to produce the desired mapping for a
particular picture.

The new current transformation matrix will contain the product of the matrix
referenced by the parameter lpMatrix and the previous current transformation
matrix (CTM = M * CTM).

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Parameter                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lpDevice                          A long pointer to a data structure of type
                                  PDEVICE, which is the destination device
                                  bitmap.

lpMatrix                          A long pointer to a three-by-three array
                                  of 32-bit integer values specifying the
                                  new transformation matrix. Entries in the
                                  matrix are scaled to represent fixed-point
                                  real numbers. Each matrix entry is scaled
                                  by 65536. Thus, the high-order WORD of the
                                  entry contains the whole integer portion,
                                  and the low-order WORD contains the
                                  fractional
                                  portion.

lpOutData                         Not used and can be set to NULL.




Return Value

This escape returns TRUE if the escape is successful and FALSE if it is
unsuccessful.


Comments

Applications should not make any assumptions about the initial value of the
current transformation matrix.

When a driver transforms a primitive using a transformation matrix modified
by the application, it should ignore the clipping rectangle specified by
GDI. Applications should specify the desired clipping rectangle using the
SET_CLIP_BOX escape.

Drivers supporting this escape must also implement the SET_CLIP_BOX,
SAVE_CTM, and RESTORE_CTM escapes.

The matrix specification used for this escape is based on the OS/2 GPI
(Graphics Programming Interface) model, which is an integer coordinate
system similar to the one used by GDI.


Japanese Escapes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The following is a list (given in the order of their escape numbers) of the
escapes that are reserved by Microsoft Japan and a short description of
each. Please contact Microsoft Japan to reserve other escape functions.

TTYMODE (Escape # 2560)          If called by an application, this call
                                 signals Kanji Windows printer drivers to
                                 disregard the passed FONTINFO data and
                                 print using the printer's default
                                 hardware font. You should not attempt to
                                 match the passed font (in FONTINFO). The

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                 match the passed font (in FONTINFO). The
                                 printer's hardware font must have the
                                 width of Roman characters equal to half
                                 the width of Kanji characters.

                                 NOTE In Windows 1.x, this was escape
                                 number 15. Since this conflicts with the
                                 standard Microsoft escape number 15
                                 (MFCOMMENT), it was relocated to the
                                 current escape number. Kanji's GDI, for
                                 Windows 2.x and later versions, checks
                                 for escape number 15 whenever called by
                                 an application and remaps it to the
                                 correct number.

GAIJIFONTSIZE (Escape # 2576)    The driver must return the standard Kanji
                                 font size in lpOutData. lpOutData points
                                 to a POINT data structure. lpInData is
                                 undefined and can be ignored.

GAIJIAREASIZE (Escape # 2577)    The driver must return as a short integer
                                 the number of Gaiji fonts that can be
                                 registered at once. Both lpInData and
                                 lpOutData are undefined and can be
                                 ignored.

GAIJISYSTEMGETFONT               The driver returns the Gaiji font pattern
(Escape # 2578)                  in a monochrome bitmap format. The low
                                 WORD of lpInData contains (not points to)
                                 the handle to the bitmap. lpOutData
                                 points to a buffer that contains the
                                 Shift-JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard)
                                 code of the Gaiji font pattern to be
                                 retrieved. If successful, the driver
                                 should return AX = TRUE.

Japanese Escape (Number)         Description/Parameters
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GAIJISYSTEMSETFONT               The driver sets the font pattern
(Escape # 2579)                  contained in the bitmap whose handle is
                                 provided in the low WORD of lpInData.
                                 lpOutData points to a buffer that
                                 contains the Shift-JIS code of the Gaiji
                                 font. If successful, the driver should
                                 return
                                 AX = TRUE.

GAIJIITTOCODE (Escape # 2580)    The driver returns the Shift-JIS code
                                 from the index to the Gaiji area.The high
                                 WORD of lpInData contains (not points to)
                                 an index to the system reserve area.
                                 lpOutData points to a buffer that will

GAIJILOCALOPEN (Escape # 2581)   The driver should get ownership of the
                                 Gaiji area. Both lpInData and lpOutData
                                 are undefined and can be ignored. If
                                 successful, the driver should return
                                 AX = TRUE.

GAIJILOCALCLOSE (Escape # 2582)  The driver releases ownership of the
                                 Gaiji area. The high WORD of lpInData
                                 contains (not points to) the handle that
                                 was returned to the caller by
                                 GAIJILOCALOPEN. lpOutData is undefined
                                 and can be ignored. If successful, the
                                 driver should return AX = TRUE.

GAIJILOCALSETFONT                The driver sets a Gaiji font and
(Escape # 2583)                  retrieves the Shift-JIS code for it. Upon
                                 entry,
                                 the low WORD of lpInData contains a

                                 containing the Gaiji font. The high WORD
                                 of lpInData contains the handle returned
                                 by GAIJILOCALOPEN. lpOutData
                                 contains a pointer to a buffer that will
                                 contain the Shift-JIS code of the Gaiji
                                 upon return.

GAIJILOCALSAVE (Escape # 2584)   Saves the current Gaiji area into global
                                 memory in hardware-specific format. The
                                 low WORD of lpInData contains
                                 the flags to be passed by the driver to
                                 GLOBALALLOC. The high WORD
                                 contains the handle returned by
                                 GAIJILOCALOPEN. lpOutData is undefined
                                 and can be ignored. This function should

Chapter 12  Data Structures and File Formats
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This chapter describes the data structures and file formats used by Windows
3.0 and the device driver functions. The data structures are presented here
in three sections:


  ■   Data structures returned by the information calls in each device
      driver used by Windows (i.e., GDIINFO, CURSORINFO, MOUSEINFO, and
      KBINFO).

  ■   Data structures used as parameters to calls on device drivers (i.e.,
      POINT, RECT, RGB, DRAWMODE, RASTEROP, CURSORSHAPE, LOGPEN, and
      LOGBRUSH).

  ■   Data structures that are device dependent; these structures contain
      information about physical devices (i.e., BITMAP, PDEVICE, PCOLOR,
      PPEN, and PBRUSH).


The data structure descriptions in this chapter are intended as a guide. The
following words, when used in the C-structure declarations discussed in this
chapter, have the meanings shown here:


  ■   char stands for a signed 8-bit integer.

  ■   short stands for a signed 16-bit integer.

  ■   long stands for a signed 32-bit integer or a long pointer stored as a
      16-bit segment address and a 16-bit offset within that segment.


Notice also that rectangles and points within a bitmap are described using a
coordinate system with its origin (X=0, Y=0) at the top-left corner of the
rectangle or point. The X coordinate increases to the right, and the Y
coordinate increases downward.

The following raster and vector font file formats are also included in this
chapter:


  ■   FONTINFO

  ■   LOGFONT




12.1  Information Data Structures

Device drivers use information data structures to tell others about
themselves. This section includes detailed information on the GDIINFO data
structure and its fields, with a separate subsection dedicated to the dpText
field's precision levels. The CURSORINFO data  structure is included both in
this section and the Mouse driver section in Chapter 9, "Miscellaneous
Drivers," which also includes the MOUSEINFO structure. KBINFO can be found
in Chapter 8, "Keyboard Drivers," and the Device Control Block (DCB)
structure is in Chapter 9, "Miscellaneous Drivers".


12.1.1  The GDIINFO Data Structure

The GDIINFO data structure describes the characteristics of the attached
graphics device in sufficient detail so that GDI can allocate space for the
required data structures. This data structure is used to describe the system
screen to Microsoft Windows.

For additional, driver-specific information about the GDIINFO data
structure, see Chapter 2, "Display Drivers," and Chapter 5, "Printer
Drivers."

The currently defined fields are as follows:

  typedef  struct  {
   short  int     dpVersion;
   short  int     dpTechnology;
   short  int     dpHorzSize;
   short  int     dpVertSize;
   short  int     dpHorzRes;

   short  int    dpPalResolution;
    } GDIINFO;


12.1.2  The GDIINFO Field Descriptions

Notice that when the term styled lines appears here, it actually means
patterned polylines.

The fields in the GDIINFO data structure have the following meanings:

                        Each precision level
                        (STRING, CHARACTER, NONE,
                        90, etc.) has a

Field                   Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                        corresponding bit in
                        dpText that is set if the
                        device is capable of that
                        precision level. Each
                        precision level within an
                        ability is a superset of
                        the precision levels
                        below it. For example, in
                        ScaleAbility, DOUBLE
                        implies NONE, INTEGER
                        implies DOUBLE and NONE,
                        and CONTINUOUS implies
                        all three. Since it is
                        required that the lowest
                        precision level of each
                        ability be supported, no
                        bit is provided in dpText
                        for the lowest level of
                        each ability. Therefore,
Field                   Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                        each ability. Therefore,
                        if INTEGER is set for
                        ScaleAbility, then DOUBLE
                        must also be set, and
                        NONE is implied.

                        If a device claims to
                        have an ability, it must
                        have it for all fonts,
                        whether realized by the
                        device or provided by GDI.

                        The bits of dpText are

                        For the IBM PC CGA (640 x
                        200 pixels) screen, these
                        fields are 5, 12, and 13,
                        respectively (that is,
                        every pixel is a 5 by 12
                        rectangle in arbitrary,
                        but un-isotropic, units).
                        This corresponds to an
                        aspect ratio of 5
                        vertical pixels to every
                        12 horizontal. For

                        not have integral
                        diagonal widths, the
                        field values can be
                        multiplied by a
                        convenient factor to
                        preserve information. For

                        aspect ratio have a
                        diagonal width of 1.414.
                        For good results, the
                        aspect fields should be
                        set to 100, 100, and 141,
                        respectively. For
                        numerical stability, the
                        field values should be
                        kept under 1000.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

The window/viewport pair fields are the numerator and denominator of the
scale fraction used to correct for the device aspect ratio and to set to a
fixed unit of measurement, either metric or English. These numbers should be
integers in the range of -32768 to 32767. When calculating these constants,
out-of-range values can be divided by some number to bring them back into
range as long as the corresponding window or viewport constant is divided by
the same number. See Chapter 2, "Display Drivers," for an example of these
calculations.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The dpRaster field is also used to indicate a scaling device. If the
RC_SCALING bit (bit 2) is set, the device does graphics scaling. Certain
devices perform graphics at one resolution and text at another. Some
applications require that character cells be an integral number of pixels.
If a device reported that its graphics resolution was 75 dpi but its text
resolution was 300 dpi, then its character cells would not be an integral
number of pixels (since they were digitized at 300 dpi). To get around this
problem, GDI uses scaling devices. The device driver registers itself as a
300 dpi device and all the graphics at 300 dpi are scaled to 75 dpi. Any
device that scales must have the RC_SCALING bit set. Scaling always reduces
the resolution, never increases it. GDI calls the Control function with
GETSCALINGFACTOR before graphics is done to a device. The scaling factor is
a SHIFT count that is a power of two. Therefore, a scale factor of 2 means
reduce by 4, and a scale factor of 1 means reduce by 2.


12.1.3  GDIINFO ─ dpText Field Precision Levels

The following is a detailed description of each of the text-support
precision levels for the GDIINFO dpText field.


OutputPrecision (STRING, CHARACTER, STROKE)

OutputPrecision specifies which font attributes the output function may
ignore. The device is not required to ignore any given attribute; it is
merely allowed to do so if that will facilitate output. OutputPrecision has
no effect on emboldening, italicizing, underlining, or strikeout. If a
device registers these abilities, it must perform them when requested.

Whenever either the character orientation or the difference between the
character orientation and the escapement angle is a multiple of 90 degrees,
the intercharacter and interword spacing will be the standard intercharacter
spacing used for bounding boxes plus the CharacterExtra and BreakExtra
spacing. (Refer to the DRAWMODE data structure for a description of
intercharacter and interword spacing.)

The standard intercharacter spacing at a given escapement angle and
character orientation is defined as the minimum spacing along the escapement
vector, such that the character origins are on the escapement vector, and
the character bounding boxes touch. Variable pitch fonts are achieved by
using variable width bounding boxes. This model applies at all attribute
values. When the sides of the bounding boxes touch, extra space is added in
X and, when the tops touch, it is added in Y.

In all other escapement and orientation cases, the standard intercharacter
spacing is device dependent. The preferred implementation is as for the
90-degree cases. In all cases, it is required that all character origins lie
on the escapement vector. The precision levels for output are described in
detail as follows:

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STRING                            This level of precision is used where
                                  simplicity and efficiency are more
                                  important than geometric precision of the
                                  text. The goal of STRING precision is to
                                  make the most use of hardware character
                                  generation as possible. The effects of the

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  and Orientation on appearance are device
                                  dependent. Height and Width are used to
                                  determine a "best-fit" character size. For
                                  STRING and CHARACTER precision, the
                                  largest font that does not exceed the
                                  requested size will be used. If no such
                                  font exists, the smallest available font
                                  will be used. Intercharacter and interword
                                  spacing must adhere to their current
                                  settings. The device has the option of
                                  ignoring escapement and character
                                  orientation. The starting point of the
                                  STRING is subject to any transforms in
                                  effect.

CHARACTER                         This level of precision is used when it is
                                  important that the string occupy a given
                                  region, such as when labeling the axes of
                                  charts and graphs. CHARACTER precision

                                  determined as for STRING precision.
                                  CHARACTER precision must adhere to
                                  escapement. Only character orientation may
                                  be ignored. The starting point of the
                                  string is subject to any transforms in
                                  effect.

STROKE                            This level of precision treats the
                                  characters as if they were generated by
                                  being stroked out as vectors. STROKE
                                  precision must adhere to all current
                                  attributes, including size. The starting
                                  point of the string is subject to any

                                  transforms in effect.




ClipPrecision (CHARACTER, STROKE)

ClipPrecision specifies how accurately StrBlt can clip. At CHARACTER
precision, a character in the string is entirely invisible if, and only if,
any portion of the character is outside the clip region. With STROKE
precision, only those portions of each character that are outside the clip
region are invisible. The rest of the character is visible.


CharRotAbility (NONE, 90, ANY)

CharRotAbility refers to the ability to rotate individual character cells.
NONE implies that characters cannot be rotated. 90 means that characters can
only be rotated in 90 degree increments. ANY implies arbitrary rotation
angles.

It is assumed that arbitrary escapement angles can be achieved, if by no
other means than, by placing each character as a separate entity. Many
devices are able to do arbitrary character rotation only if the character
orientation matches the escapement angle. For such devices, it is assumed
that the driver will place each character individually at the proper
orientation and escapement, when escapement and character orientation do not
match.


ScaleFreedom (X_YIDENTICAL, X_YINDEPENDENT)

ScaleFreedom specifies how the characters in a font may be scaled.
X_YIDENTICAL means that the characters must be scaled by the same amount in
each direction. X_YINDEPENDENT implies that the characters may be scaled
independently in each direction.


ScaleAbility (NONE, DOUBLE, INTEGER, CONTINUOUS)

ScaleAbility specifies by what amount the characters can be scaled. NONE
implies no scaling. DOUBLE means the characters can be doubled. INTEGER
allows any integer multiple. CONTINUOUS gives exact scaling. Whenever a
device cannot match a requested size exactly, because of X_YIDENTICAL or
noncontinuous scaling, it is required that the device use the largest size
available that will not exceed the requested size in either direction.


EmboldenAbility (NONE, DOUBLE)

EmboldenAbility indicates whether or not StrBlt can alter the weight of a
font. NONE implies nothing can be done. DOUBLE can double the weight,
usually by shifting one pixel and overstriking. This ability is not affected
by OutputPrecision.


ItalicizeAbility (UNABLE, ABLE)

ItalicizeAbility is set ABLE if StrBlt can take a nonitalic font and skew it
to make it italic. This ability is not affected by OutputPrecision.


UnderlineAbility (UNABLE, ABLE)

UnderlineAbility is set ABLE if StrBlt can underline a font. This ability is
not affected by OutputPrecision.


StrikeOutAbility (UNABLE, ABLE)

StrikeOutAbility is set ABLE if StrBlt can strike out a font by drawing a
line through it. This ability is not affected by OutputPrecision.


RasterFontAble (UNABLE, ABLE)

RasterFontAble indicates whether or not the device is capable of using
raster format fonts.


VectorFontAble (UNABLE, ABLE)

VectorFontAble indicates whether or not the device is capable of using
vector format fonts.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

If the device driver returns the abilities listed below, it need never
implement or adhere to any of the font attributes. The only parameters
affecting output will be the font face (physical font), fixed or variable
pitch, and text justification as specified in the DRAWMODE data structure.
 OutputPrecision: STRING ClipPrecision: CHARACTER CharRotAbility: NONE
ScaleFreedom: X_YIDENTICAL ScaleAbility: NONE EmboldenAbility: NONE
ItalicizeAbility: UNABLE UnderlineAbility: UNABLE StrikeOutAbility: UNABLE
RasterFontAble: UNABLE or ABLE VectorFontAble: UNABLE or ABLE  The
ClipPrecision ability must be implemented with STROKE precision on the
console device for Microsoft Windows to operate properly.

12.2  Parameter Data Structures

The following are the data structures that are used as parameters to the
functions described in this DDK document.


12.2.1  POINT ─ Point Data Structure

This data structure describes the format of a point as used by other data
structures.

  typedef struct {
   short  x;
   short  y;
   } POINT;

The fields in this data structure have the following meanings:

╓┌────────────────┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
Field            Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
x                The X-coordinate value of a point.
y                The Y-coordinate value of a point.



12.2.2  RECT ─ Rectangle Data Structure

A rectangle is characterized by two points.

  typedef struct {
   short   left,   top;
   short   right,  bottom;
   } RECT;

The fields in this data structure have the following meanings:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
left, top                         The coordinates that specify the
                                  upper-left corner of the rectangle (points
                                  inclusive).

right, bottom                     The coordinates that specify the
                                  lower-right corner of the rectangle
                                  (points exclusive).



────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

The "right, bottom" coordinates are actually one greater than the actual
size the rectangle would appear to require. Therefore, if passed a "right,
bottom" coordinate pair of (640,480), the device driver should use a
rectangle with its lower right corner at (639,479).
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


12.2.3  RGB ─ Logical Color Specification

A logical color specifies the color desired by an application.

  typedef long RGB;

The long integer is divided into four 1-byte fields, three of which specify
the intensity of the primary colors. The intensities of the color values are
on a scale of 0-255. The values are packed in the low three bytes of the
long integer in the following format:

  typedef struct {
   BYTE red;
   BYTE green;
   BYTE blue;
   BYTE flags;
   } RGB;

That is, the lowest-order byte contains Red information, the next byte
contains Green information, and the third byte contains Blue information.
For palette-capable devices, if the high byte is 00H, then this is an RGB
color. However, if the high byte (i.e., flags) is 0FFH, then the low WORD is
a color index, not an RGB.

Each byte represents an intensity level for the specified color (i.e., red,
green, and blue); 0 is the minimum intensity, 255 the maximum. When the
colors are combined, they form a new color. For example, when the colors are
at minimum intensity (0,0,0), the result is black. When the colors are at
maximum intensity (255, 255, 255), the result is white. Gray is half
intensity in all colors (127,127,127); solid green is (0, 255, 0), and so
on.

If a display device is not capable of all the possible RGB color
combinations, the OEM must decide which colors to display for the given RGB
color values. For example, in a black and white display with only one bit
per pixel, the OEM must choose a cutoff intensity at which all the RGB
values above the intensity are white and all below are black. One method
used to compute the cutoff intensity is to add the individual color
intensities according to the following formula:

  ((5*G+3*R+B)+4)&gt;&gt;3

If the result is greater than 128, then all the RGB values above that
intensity will be white, and those below it will be black.


12.2.4  DRAWMODE ─ Drawing Mode Specification

A drawing mode includes the information required to draw lines on a display.

  typedef struct {
   short   Rop2;
   short   BackgroundMode;
   pColor  BackgroundColor;
   pColor  TextColor;
   short   TBreakExtra;
   short   BreakExtra;
   short   BreakErr;
   short   BreakRem;
   short   BreakCount;
   short   CharacterExtra;
   pColor  LogicalBGColor;
   pColor  LogicalTextColor;
   } DRAWMODE;

The fields within the DRAWMODE structure have the following meanings:

╓┌────────────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────┌───┌─────────►
Field            Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

BackgroundMode   A short integer specifying whether parts of
                 lines not being drawn in foreground color
                 should be drawn in the background color
                 (opaque background) or left transparent

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                 (transparent background). This mode also
                 applies when a brush is used for interiors,
                 scanlines, and text. Notice, though, that
                 only styled pens, hatched brushes, and text
                 can be transparent. Any other pen or brush
                 will be drawn opaque, regardless of the
                 background mode.

BackgroundColor  A physical color specifying the background
                 color to be used. See Section 12.3.3,
                 "PCOLOR ─ Physical Color Definition," for
                 more information about the PCOLOR data
                 structure.

TextColor        A physical color specifying the text color

The remaining fields in DRAWMODE specify text justification as follows:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TBreakExtra                       A short integer specifying the total
                                  number of pixels that must be shared by,
                                  and inserted into, all the character
                                  breaks in the string(s) output. Also known
                                  as the Proportional String flag.

BreakErr                          A short integer that maintains a running
                                  error term to be used by StrBlt to track
                                  the number of BreakRem pixels that have
                                  been consumed. This error term allows an
                                  application to do justification across a
                                  line composed of several different output
                                  strings using different fonts.

BreakRem                          A short integer specifying the remaining
                                  pixels to be scattered among the character
                                  breaks: mod (TBreakExtra, BreakCount).

BreakCount                        A short integer specifying the number of
                                  character breaks into which the extra

                                  inserted.

CharacterExtra                    A short integer specifying in pixels (or

LogicalBGColor                    Specifies the logical background color.
                                  See Section 12.3.3, "PCOLOR ─ Physical

                                  about the PCOLOR data structure.

LogicalTextColor                  Specifies the logical text color. See

                                  the PCOLOR data structure.



────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

If no justification is required, TBreakExtra will be set to zero. To enable
justification, GDI will set TBreakExtra and BreakCount to the desired
values. The other justification fields are evaluated using these values and
BreakErr is set to BreakCount/2+1.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

It is expected that StrBlt will be implemented as described below, but any
implementation that spreads the excess pixels across the character breaks
satisfies the requirements of text justification.

  width = width of char
  if TBreakExtra &lt;&gt; 0 and char = BreakChar then
   width = width + BreakExtra
   BreakErr = BreakErr - BreakRem
   if BreakErr &lt;= 0 then
    width = width + 1
    BreakErr = BreakErr + BreakCount
   endif
  endif
  width = width + CharacterExtra move over by width


12.2.5  RASTEROP ─ Raster Operations

A raster operation specifies how to combine the source, pattern, and
destination during a BitBlt.

GDI RASTEROP includes the complete set of Boolean functions, using the
binary operators AND, OR, and XOR, and the unary operator NOT, on three
variables. Those combining functions are listed in Chapter 14, "Raster
Operation Codes and Definitions," where the actual name and reverse Polish
notation for each value are given. Notice that the actual values used to
denote the 256 functions are 32-bit unsigned integers. Therefore, the table
of values is sparse, and one must be careful when specifying the RASTEROP.

Chapter 14, "Raster Operation Codes and Definitions," also includes a
description of the process used to generate the 32-bit numbers.

Some of the more commonly used raster operation codes are listed below:

  #define SRCCOPY       0x00CC0020 /*dest=source */
  #define SRCPAINT      0x00EE0086 /*dest=source OR dest */
  #define SRCAND        0x008800C6 /*dest=source AND dest */
  #define SRCINVERT     0x00660046 /*dest=source XOR dest */
  #define SRCERASE      0x00440328 /*dest=source AND (NOT dest ) */
  #define NOTSRCCOPY    0x00330008 /*dest=(NOT source) */
  #define NOTSRCERASE   0x001100A6 /*dest=(NOT source) AND (NOT dest) */
  #define MERGECOPY     0x00C000CA /*dest=(source AND pattern) */
  #define MERGEPAINT    0x00BB0226 /*dest=(source AND pattern) OR dest */
  #define PATCOPY       0x00F00021 /*dest=pattern */
  #define PATPAINT      0x00FB0A09 /*DPSnoo */
  #define PATINVERT     0x005A0049 /*dest=pattern XOR dest */
  #define DSTINVERT     0x00550009 /*dest=(NOT dest) */
  #define BLACKNESS     0x00000042 /*dest=BLACK */
  #define WHITENESS     0x00FF0062 /*dest=WHITE */


12.2.6  CURSORSHAPE ─ Cursor Data Structure

The CURSORSHAPE data structure is used by Microsoft Windows to generate a
cursor on a physical display at the current cursor position. A cursor
contains a hotspot within the cursor shape that is aligned with the cursor
position. It also contains two bitmaps of equal size that are used to
determine the appearance of the cursor as a function of the display contents
under the cursor. The first bitmap is ANDed with the contents of the display
and the second bitmap is XORed with the result to generate the final
appearance of the cursor as opaque white, opaque black, transparent, or
invert.

  typedef struct {
   short csHotX;
   short csHotY;
   short csWidth;
   short csHeight;
   short csWidthBytes;
   short csColor;
   char  csBits;
   } CURSORSHAPE;

The fields within the CURSORSHAPE structure have the following meanings:

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
csHotX, csHotY                    A point within the cursor shape that
                                  should be aligned with the cursor position
                                  when displaying the cursor. Negative
                                  coordinates are allowed, so that the
                                  hotspot can lie outside the cursor shape.

csWidth                           Width of the cursor shape in pixels.

csHeight                          Height of the cursor shape in raster lines.

csWidthBytes                      Width of the cursor shape in bytes. This
                                  is currently 4.

csColor                           Format of color information in following
                                  pixel array. This field should contain
                                  zero.

csBits                            An array of bits containing the two masks
                                  that define the cursor shape. The first
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  that define the cursor shape. The first
                                  csHeight*csWidthBytes bytes define the AND
                                  mask. The second csHeight*csWidthBytes
                                  bytes define the XOR mask.




12.2.7  LOGPEN ─ Logical Pen Attribute Information

Pens are used to draw lines or perimeters.

  typedef struct {
   long  lopnStyle;
   POINT lopnWidth;
   long  lopnColor;
   } LOGPEN;

The fields within the LOGPEN structure have the following meanings:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lopnStyle                         A long integer value specifying the type
                                  of interruptions to be used in generating
                                  the pen. Predefined pen styles (with
                                  indexes 0-5,
                                  respectively) include:

                                  LS_SOLID
                                  LS_DASHED
                                  LS_DOTTED

                                  LS_DASHDOTDOT
                                  LS_NOLINE

                                  Any other style should be ignored.

lopnWidth                         A data structure of POINT type whose x
                                  field specifies the
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  field specifies the
                                  width and height of dots created by the
                                  pen (in device units). A zero-width pen is
                                  drawn with the system's smallest width.
                                  Negative-width pens have no width and are
                                  NULL pens. The
                                  y field is ignored.

lopnColor                         A long integer specifying the RGB color
                                  with which the pen is to be drawn. However,
                                  for palette-capable devices, if the high
                                  byte is 0FFH, then the low WORD is a color
                                  index. Use that index for the physical
                                  color in the corresponding PPEN structure.
                                  If the high byte is 00H, then you have an
                                  RGB.




12.2.8  LOGBRUSH ─ Logical Brush Attribute Information

Brushes are used to fill interiors.

  typedef struct {
   short  lbStyle;
   long   lbColor;
   short  lbHatch;
   long   lbBkColor;
   } LOGBRUSH;

The fields within the LOGBRUSH structure have the following meanings:

╓┌──────────┌─────────────────────────────────┌──────────────────────────────►
Field      Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lbStyle    Selects the type of brush.
           Predefined brush types (with
           indexes 0-3,
           respectively) include the
Field      Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
           respectively) include the
           following:

           BS_SOLID
           BS_HOLLOW
           BS_HATCHED
           BS_PATTERN

           The information in the remaining
           fields varies depending on the
           brush type selected.

lbColor    If the brush style is BS_HOLLOW,
           the lbColor field is not used.
           If it is BS_PATTERN, the field
           is a long pointer to the
           physical bitmap (type BITMAP)
           defining the pattern. If the
           brush style is BS_SOLID or
Field      Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
           brush style is BS_SOLID or
           BS_HATCHED, the lbColor field
           specifies the color in which the
           brush is to be drawn. However,
           for palette-capable devices, if
           the high byte is 0FFH, then the
           low WORD is a color index. Use
           that index for the physical
           color in the corresponding
           PBRUSH structure. If the high
           byte is 00H, then you have an
           RGB.

lbHatch    If the brush style is BS_SOLID
           or BS_HOLLOW, the lbHatch field
           is not used. If the brush style
           is BS_HATCHED, the lbHatch field
           specifies the orientation of the
           lines used to create the hatch.
Field      Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
           lines used to create the hatch.
           The possible hatch values are as

lbBkColor  If the brush style is BS_HATCHED,
           the lbBkColor field specifies
           the background color of the
           hatched brush. However, for
           palette-capable devices, if the
           high byte is 0FFH, then the low
           WORD is a color index. Use that
           index for the physical color in
           the corresponding PBRUSH
           structure. If the high byte is
           00H, then you have an RGB.




12.3  Physical Data Structures

This section describes data structures that contain information about
physical devices. These data structures vary across devices, and their
definition depends on the actual device.


12.3.1  BITMAP ─ Physical Bitmap Data Structure

A physical bitmap describes a rectangle of bits in main memory (private
bitmap).

  typedef struct {
   short bmType;
   short bmWidth;
   short bmHeight;
   short bmWidthBytes;
   byte  bmPlanes;
   byte  bmBitsPixel;
   long  bmBits;
   long  bmWidthPlanes;
   long  bmlpPDevice;
   short bmSegmentIndex;
   short bmScanSegment;
   short bmFillBytes;
   short reserved1;
   short reserved2;
   } BITMAP;

The fields within the BITMAP structure have the following meanings:

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
bmType                            If the memory backing the bitmap is
                                  allocated in main memory, this field is
                                  zero, and the remaining fields in the data
                                  structure have the meanings defined here.
                                  If this is a display bitmap (i.e., the
                                  physical surface), bmType is a unique
                                  number describing that physical display,
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  number describing that physical display,
                                  and the remaining information in the data
                                  structure is as defined by the OEM (see
                                  the PDEVICE structure description). This
                                  field permits hardware architectures to
                                  treat display memory differently than main
                                  memory, which may be of importance if the
                                  display bitmap is organized differently
                                  than bitmaps in main memory. For physical
                                  display bitmaps, this field and all the
                                  remaining fields are initialized by the
                                  OEM-supplied Enable function for the
                                  dedicated display.

bmWidth                           Width of the bitmap in pixels.

bmHeight                          Height of the bitmap in raster lines.

bmWidthBytes                      Number of bytes in each raster line of
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
bmWidthBytes                      Number of bytes in each raster line of
                                  this bitmap. This value is precomputed for
                                  easy calculation of the address of the
                                  next raster line. bmWidthBytes must be an
                                  even number so that all the scanlines will
                                  be aligned on a WORD boundary.

bmPlanes                          Specifies the number of planes in the
                                  frame-buffer memory.

bmBitsPixel                       Specifies the number of adjacent bits on
                                  each plane that are involved in making up
                                  a pixel.

bmBits                            A long pointer to the array of pixels for
                                  this bitmap. For main memory bitmaps, this
                                  is an actual memory address. This memory
                                  address is guaranteed to be aligned on a
                                  WORD boundary.
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  WORD boundary.

bmWidthPlanes                     Specifies the width in bytes of each plane
                                  involved in making up the bitmap. It is
                                  equal to bmWidthBytes*bmHeight.

bmlpPDevice                       A long pointer to the PDEVICE structure of
                                  the device for which this bitmap is
                                  compatible.

bmSegmentIndex                    For bitmaps that are greater than 64K in
                                  length, this field is nonzero. Otherwise,
                                  it is zero. It is used as a flag to tell
                                  you whether or not you have a "huge"
                                  bitmap. To compute the segment address for
                                  segment n, add n*bmSegmentIndex to the
                                  starting segment address of the bitmap.

bmScanSegment                     Specifies the number of raster (scan)
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
bmScanSegment                     Specifies the number of raster (scan)
                                  lines contained in each (64K) segment of a
                                  "huge" bitmap. (It is not used for small
                                  bitmaps.) The total number of segments is
                                  equal to ceiling
                                  of (bmHeight/bmScanSegment). A raster line
                                  is equal to bmWidthBytes bytes. No segment
                                  may contain more than 64K.

bmFillBytes                       Specifies the number of extra bytes in
                                  each segment. Bitmaps are allocated on
                                  16-byte boundaries.




A Huge Bitmap Example

This example is for a display, such as the 4-plane EGA, that registers
itself (in the GDIINFO data structure) as having more than one bitplane. The
following is the bitmap in RAM:

        Huge Bitmap, in RAM

All the planes of a particular scanline must fit within the segment.
Otherwise, go to the next segment and leave bmFillBytes worth of empty bytes
at the end of the current segment.


12.3.2  PDEVICE ─ Physical Device Data Structure

This data structure varies across devices. Device-dependent information can
be stored in this data structure to indicate the current state of a given
device. The type of information stored may include the current pen, the
current position, and the communication port of a particular device.

The PDEVICE data structure is allocated by GDI before any call to enable a
device driver. The size of this data structure may vary and must be
specified in the dpDEVICEsize field of the GDIINFO data structure. A single
field is present in all cases, which allows GDI to determine whether this is
a system display or some other device.

  typedef struct {
   short magic;
   } PDEVICE;

The first WORD is the one constant field in this data structure that is
required for all devices. This field, when zero, specifies that the device
is a memory bitmap. When the field is nonzero, it specifies that the device
is a physical system display bitmap. The Enable function sets this field to
a nonzero value.


12.3.3  PCOLOR ─ Physical Color Definition

A physical color specifies the color bits to be activated to achieve a given
color on the device.

  typedef long PCOLOR;

The definition of a physical color differs, depending on whether the colors
are generated by contiguous bits or by multiple color planes. This
specification is entirely dependent on the device.

GDI does not use physical colors directly. Instead, it passes them to the
appropriate output functions to be realized by the device driver.


12.3.4  PPEN ─ Physical Pen Data Structure

The PPEN structure is filled by the RealizeObject function and passed to the
Output function to specify the physical pen to be used for drawing lines.
The exact size and content of a physical pen depend on the device for which
it is formed. The RealizeObject function must fill this structure with
appropriate values by translating the logical pen definition passed to it
into physical pen specifications for the device. Before calling
RealizeObject, GDI allocates sufficient space for the structure by calling
RealizeObject with a NULL pointer to the Output object to get the size of
the structure for which it needs to allocate space.


12.3.5  PBRUSH ─ Physical Brush Data Structure

The PBRUSH structure is filled by the RealizeObject function and passed to
the Output function to specify the physical brush to be used for painting
regions. The exact size and content of a physical brush depends on the
device for which it is formed. The RealizeObject function must fill this
structure with appropriate values by translating the logical brush
definition passed to it into physical brush specifications for the device.
Before calling RealizeObject, GDI allocates sufficient space for the
structure by calling RealizeObject with a NULL pointer to the Output object
to get the size of the structure for which it needs to allocate space.


12.4  Raster and Vector Font File Formats

In addition to the information in the header of the file, a raster font file
contains a string of bytes, the actual bitmap, just as it will be loaded
into contiguous memory by GDI. That string begins in the file at the offset
specified in the dfBitsPointer field described in the following section.

The header information for a vector font file is also described in the
following section. This section describes some additional information for
vector font files.

Each character is composed of a series of vectors consisting of a pair of
signed relative coordinate pairs starting from the character cell origin.
Each pair may be preceded by a special value indicating that the next
coordinate is to be a pen-up move. The special pen-up value depends on how
the coordinates are stored. For 1-byte quantities, it is -128 (080H) and for
2-byte quantities, it is -32768 (08000H).

The character cell origin must be at the upper-left corner of the cell so
that the character hangs down and to the right of where it is placed.

The storage format for the coordinates depends on the size of the font. If
either dfPixHeight or dfMaxWidth is greater than 128, the coordinates are
stored as 2-byte quantities; otherwise, they are stored as 1-byte
quantities.


12.4.1  FONTINFO ─ The Physical Font Descriptor

A font descriptor contains all the information about a physical font needed
by the low-level character draw primitives. This data structure is identical
to the font file format described in Chapter 13, "The Font File Format," but
with two exceptions. First, this FONTINFO does not include the dfVersion,
dfSize, and dfCopyright fields. Second, the dfDevice, dfFace, dfBitsPointer,
and dfBitsOffset fields are offset from the beginning of the segment
containing the FONTINFO data structure rather than from the beginning of the
file.

For Windows 3.0, these two versions of FONTINFO now include six new fields:
dfFlags, dfAspace, dfBspace, dfCspace, dfColorPointer, and dfReserved1. All
device drivers can still support the Windows 2.x version of FONTINFO.
However, not all of them will understand the Windows 3.0 version. To do so
and access only Windows 3.0, a display driver must have the RC_BIGFONT bit
set in the raster capabilities field of GDIINFO. Otherwise, it will get the
2.x version. Printer drivers call the GDI function GetDeviceCaps() to see
what bit the display driver has set under RC_BIGFONT in GDIINFO.

The Windows 3.0 versions of FONTINFO also include the glyph table in
dfCharTable, which consists of structures that describe the bits for the
characters in the font file. These versions enable fonts to grow to more
than 64K in size (i.e., the size limit in 0x200 fonts). This is made
possible by the use of 32-bit offsets to the character glyphs in
dfCharTable.

Because of the 32-bit offsets and their potentially large size, these fonts
are primarily designed for use on systems that are running in protected
mode, in which there is lots of memory, and on an 80386 (or higher)
processor, where 32-bit registers can be used to get the character glyphs.
Therefore, we recommend that a device driver use 0x300 fonts (i.e., turn on
the RC_BIGFONT bit) only when the preceding conditions are present. If those
conditions are not met, 0x200 fonts are the better format. See the VGA
sources on the DDK disks for sample code that supports different formats,
depending on the Windows environment.

The following are the fields of the FONTINFO data structure:

  typedef struct {
   short dfType;
   short dfPoints;
   short dfVertRes;
   short dfHorizRes;
   short dfAscent;
   short dfInternalLeading;
   short dfExternalLeading;
   char  dfItalic;
   char  dfUnderline;
   char  dfStrikeOut;
   short dfWeight;
   char  dfCharSet;
   short dfPixWidth;
   short dfPixHeight;
   char  dfPitchAndFamily;
   short dfAvgWidth;
   short dfMaxWidth;
   char  dfFirstChar;
   char  dfLastChar;
   char  dfDefaultChar;
   char  dfBreakChar;
   short dfWidthBytes;
   long  dfDevice;
   long  dfFace;
   long  dfBitsPointer;
   long  dfBitsOffset;
   char  dfReserved;
   long  dfFlags;
   short dfAspace;
   short dfBspace;
   short dfCspace;
   long  dfColorPointer;
   long  dfReserved1[4];
   short dfCharTable[n];
   char  Facename[n];
   char  Devicename[n];
   char  BitMaps[n];
   } FONTINFO;

The fields within the FONTINFO structure have the following meanings:

╓┌──────────────────────┌──────────────────────┌────────────┌────────────────►
Field                  Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
dfType                 Two bytes specifying
                       the type of font file.
Field                  Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                       the type of font file.

                       The low-order byte is
                       for exclusive GDI use.
                       If the low-order bit
                       of the WORD is zero,
                       it is a bitmap
                       (raster) font file.
                       If the low-order bit
                       is 1, it is a vector
                       font file. The second
                       bit is reserved and
                       must be zero. If no
                       bits follow in the
                       file and the bits are
                       located in memory at
                       a fixed address
                       specified in
                       dfBitsOffset, the

                       bit is set
                       to zero. The
                       high-order bit of the
                       low byte is set if
                       the font
                       was realized by a
                       device. The remaining
                       bits in the low byte
                       are reserved and set
                       to zero.

                       The high byte is
                       reserved for device

                       characters in the
                       font. For fixed-pitch
                       fonts, this is the
                       same as dfPixWidth.

                       code defined by this
                       font. Character
                       definitions are
                       stored only for the
                       characters
                       actually present in a
                       font, so this field

                       calculating indexes
                       into either dfBits or

                       dfFirstChar. Ideally,
                       dfDefaultChar should
                       be a visible
                       character in the

                       relative to
                       dfFirstChar so that
                       dfBreakChar is the

                       character less
                       dfFirstChar.
                       dfBreakChar is

                       fonts. dfWidthBytes
                       is always an even
                       quantity so that rows
                       of the bitmap start
                       on WORD boundaries.

dfDevice               Four bytes specifying
                       the offset from the

                       Windows 3.0 for each
                       character in the font.
                       The first two bytes
                       give the width of the
                       character in pixels.
                       In Windows 2.x, the
                       second two bytes give
                       the offset to the
                       beginning of the
                       character from the

                       3.0, the next four
                       bytes are used for
                       the offset.

                       For fixed pitch
                       vector fonts, each
                       2-byte entry in this
                       array specifies the
                       offset from the start
                       of the bitmap to the
                       beginning of the

                       subtracting its entry
                       from the next one.

                       For proportionally
                       spaced vector fonts,
                       each 4-byte entry is
                       divided into two
                       2-byte fields. The
                       first field gives the
                       starting offset from
                       the start of the
                       bitmap of the

                       The second field
                       gives the pixel width
                       of the character.

                       entry at the end of
                       the dfCharTable table.
                       This is to allow you
                       to calculate the
                       width or number of
                       bytes of definition
                       of the last character.
                       Though this applies
                       only to vector fonts,
                       the entry is present
                       for all fonts.

                       Each row of a raster
                       bitmap must start on
                       a WORD boundary. This
                       implies that the end
                       of each row must be
                       padded to an even
                       length.



────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

When a device realizes a font using the RealizeObject function, the dfFace
and dfDevice fields must point to valid character strings containing the
face and device names.

The Windows 2.x version of dfCharTable has a GlyphEntry structure with the
following format:

  GlyphEntry struc
  geWidth   dw ? ; width of character bitmap in pixels
  geOffset  dw ? ; pointer to the bits
  GlyphEntry ends

The Windows 3.0 version of dfCharTable is dependent on the format of the
Glyph bitmap.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

The only format supported in Windows 3.0 will be DFF_FIXED and
DFF_PROPORTIONAL.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  DFF_FIXED
  DFF_PROPORTIONAL

  GlyphEntry struc
  geWidth   dw ? ; width of character bitmap in pixels
  geOffset  dd ? ; pointer to the bits
  GlyphEntry ends

  DFF_ABCFIXED
  DFF_ABCPROPORTIONAL

  GlyphEntry struc
  geWidth   dw ? ; width of character bitmap in pixels
  geOffset  dd ? ; pointer to the bits
  geAspace  dd ? ; A space in fractional pixels (16.16)
  geBspace  dd ? ; B space in fractional pixels (16.16)
  geCspace  dd ? ; C space in fractional pixels (16.16)
  GlyphEntry ends

The fractional pixels are expressed as a 32-bit signed number with an
implicit binary point between bits 15 and 16. This is referred to as a 16.16
("sixteen dot sixteen") fixed-point number.

The ABC spacing here is the same as defined above. However, here there are
specific sets for each character.

  DFF_1COLOR
  DFF_16COLOR
  DFF_256COLOR
  DFF_RGBCOLOR

  GlyphEntry struc
  geWidth  dw ? ; width of character bitmap in pixels
  geOffset  dd ? ; pointer to the bits
  geHeight  dw ? ; height of character bitmap in pixels
  geAspace  dd ? ; A space in fractional pixels (16.16)
  geBspace  dd ? ; B space in fractional pixels (16.16)
  geCspace  dd ? ; C space in fractional pixels (16.16)
  GlyphEntry ends

  DFF_1COLOR means 8 pixels per byte

  DFF_16COLOR means 2 pixels per byte

  DFF_256COLOR means 1 pixel per byte

  DFF_RGBCOLOR means RGBquads


12.4.2  LOGFONT ─ The Logical Font Descriptor

A logical font descriptor contains all the parameters for a logical font
needed by the output primitives.

  typedef struct {
   short lfHeight;
   short lfWidth;
   short lfEscapement;
   short lfOrientation;
   short lfWeight;
   BYTE  lfItalic;
   BYTE  lfUnderline;
   BYTE  lfStrikeOut;
   BYTE  lfCharSet;
   BYTE  lfOutPrecision;
   BYTE  lfClipPrecision;
   BYTE  lfQuality;
   BYTE  lfPitchAndFamily;
   BYTE  lfFaceName [32];
   } LOGFONT;

The fields within the LOGFONT data structure have the following meanings:

╓┌─────────────────┌──────────────────────────────┌──────────────────────────►
Field             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lfHeight          Specifies the height of the
                  font in user units. The
                  height of a font can be
                  specified in three ways.

                  If lfHeight is greater than
                  zero, it is transformed into
                  device units and matched
Field             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  device units and matched
                  against the cell height of
                  the available
                  fonts. If lfHeight is zero, a
                  reasonable default size is
                  used. If lfHeight is less
                  than zero, it is transformed
                  into device units and the
                  absolute value is matched
                  against the character height
                  of the available fonts. (i.e.,
                  cell height - internal
                  leading).

                  For all height comparisons,
                  the font mapper looks for the
                  largest font that does not
                  exceed the requested size and,
                  if
Field             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  if
                  there is no such font, looks
                  for the smallest font
                  available.

lfWidth           Specifies the average width
                  of characters in the font in
                  user units. If lfWidth is
                  zero, the aspect ratio of the
                  device will be matched
                  against the digitization
                  aspect ratio of the available
                  fonts looking for the closest
                  match by absolute value of
                  the difference.

lfEscapement      Specifies the angle,
                  counterclockwise from the x
                  -axis in tenths of a degree,
Field             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  -axis in tenths of a degree,
                  of the vector passing through
                  the origin of all the
                  characters in the string.

lfOrientation     Specifies the angle,
                  counterclockwise from the x
                  -axis in tenths of a degree,
                  of the baseline of the
                  character.

lfWeight          Specifies the weight of the
                  font ranging from 1 to 1000,
                  with 400 being the value for
                  the standard font. Passing a
                  weight of zero signals the
                  font mapper to choose any
                  value.

Field             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

lfItalic          A 1-byte flag that specifies
                  whether or not the font is to
                  be italic. If the low bit is
                  set, the font is to be italic.
                  All other bits are to be zero.

lfUnderline       A 1-byte flag that specifies
                  whether or not the font is to
                  be
                  underlined. If the low bit is
                  set, the font is to be
                  underlined.
                  All other bits are to be zero.

lfStrikeOut       A 1-byte flag that specifies
                  whether or not the font is to
                  be struck out. If the low bit
                  is set, the font is to be
Field             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  is set, the font is to be
                  struck out.
                  All other bits are to be zero.

lfCharSet         Specifies the character set
                  to be used. It can be either
                  of the
                  following:

                  ANSI_CHARSET                   (00H)

                  OEM_CHARSET                    (FFH)

                  SYMBOL_CHARSET                 (02H)

                  The ANSI character set is
                  recommended since it is
                  constant across Windows
                  machines and is available in
Field             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  machines and is available in
                  more fonts than any other set.
                  The OEM character set depends
                  on the specific machine. See
                  Chapter 15, "Miscellaneous
                  Character Set
                  Tables," for a table of the
                  ANSI and Symbol character
                  sets
                  and the OEM character set
                  distributed with the IBM PC.

lfOutPrecision    Specifies the required output
                  precision for text. Output
                  precision is described in
                  detail in the GDIINFO data
                  structure. Output precision
                  may be one of the following
                  values:
Field             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  values:

                  OUT_STROKE_PRECIS              (03H)

lfClipPrecision   Specifies the required
                  clipping precision for text.
                  Clipping precision is
                  described in detail in the
                  GDIINFO data structure.
                  Clipping precision may be one
                  of the following values:

                  CLIP_STROKE_PRECIS             (02H)

lfQuality         A 1-byte flag that provides a
                  hint to the font mapper as to
                  what quality output is
                  required. A hint is
                  information that the mapper
                  may use when it needs
                  additional clarification to
                  make a choice of which
                  physical font to use. Quality
                  may be one of the
                  following values:

lfPitchAndFamily  Specifies the font pitch and
                  family. The low 2 bits
                  specify the pitch of the font
                  and can be any one of the
                  following:

                  The high 4 bits of the field
                  specify the font family. The
                  constants are defined such
                  that the proper value can be
                  obtained by ORing together
                  one pitch constant with one
                  family constant. The font
                  family name describes in a
                  general way the look of a
                  font. Family names are
                  intended for specifying fonts
                  when the exact facename
                  desired is not available. The
                  families are as

lfFaceName        An ASCII character string
                  specifying the facename of
                  the font. The size of this
                  field is the length of the
                  string plus a NULL
                  terminator; it must not
                  exceed 32, including the NULL.

                  A string consisting of a
                  single NULL indicates that
                  any font face may be used.








Chapter 13  The Font File Format
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This chapter provides information on the three main data structures (i.e.,
TEXTMETRIC, TEXTXFORM, and FONTINFO) used to describe the physical font, its
basic metrics, and the actual appearance of the text on the display device.



13.1  TEXTMETRIC ─ Basic Font Metrics

The TEXTMETRIC structure is a list of the basic metrics of a physical font.
The structure is returned by the EnumDFonts function.

  typedef struct {
   short  tmHeight;
   short  tmAscent;
   short  tmDescent;
   short  tmInternalLeading;
   short  tmExternalLeading;
   short  tmAveCharWidth;
   short  tmMaxCharWidth;
   short  tmWeight;
   BYTE   tmItalic;
   BYTE   tmUnderlined;
   BYTE   tmStruckOut;
   BYTE   tmFirstChar;
   BYTE   tmLastChar;
   BYTE   tmDefaultChar;
   BYTE   tmBreakChar;
   BYTE   tmPitchAndFamily;
   BYTE   tmCharSet;
   short  tmOverhang;
   short  tmDigitizedAspectX;
   short  tmDigitizedAspectY;
   } TEXTMETRIC;

The TEXTMETRIC fields are described below. All the sizes are given in
normalized units (i.e., they depend on the current mapping mode of the
display context).

                                        (units above the baseline).

tmDescent                               Specifies the descent of characters
                                        (units below the baseline).

                                        this area is outside of the font
                                        proper, it contains no marks and will
                                        not be altered by text output calls i
                                        either the OPAQUE or TRANSPARENT mode
                                        This may be zero at the designer's
                                        option.

tmAveCharWidth                          Specifies the average width of
                                        characters in the font (loosely
                                        defined as the width of the letter
                                        "X").

tmMaxCharWidth                          Specifies the maximum width of any
                                        character in the font.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

tmBreakChar                             Specifies the value of the character
                                        that is to be used to define word
                                        breaks for text justification.

tmPitchAndFamily                        Specifies the pitch and family of the
                                        selected font. The low bit is set if
                                        the font is variable pitch. The high
                                        four bits give the family of the font
                                        Refer to the LOGFONT structure given
                                        in Chapter 12, "Data Structures and
                                        File Formats," for a description of
                                        the font families.

tmCharSet                               Specifies the character set of the
                                        font.

tmOverhang                              Specifies the per string extra width
                                        that may be added to some synthesized
Field                                   Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                        that may be added to some synthesized
                                        fonts. When synthesizing some
                                        attributes such as bold or italic, GD
                                        or a device may have to add width to
                                        string on both a per character and pe
                                        string basis.

                                        For example, GDI emboldens a string b
                                        expanding the intracharacter spacing
                                        and overstriking with an offset. It
                                        italicizes a font by skewing the
                                        string. In either case, there is an
                                        overhang past the basic string. For
                                        bold strings, it is the distance by
                                        which the overstrike is offset. For
                                        italic strings, it is the amount the
                                        top of the font is skewed past the
                                        bottom of the font.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

                                        The tmOverhang field enables the
                                        application to determine the
                                        following:

                                        1. How much of the character width
                                        returned by a GetTextExtent call on a
                                        single character is the actual
                                        character width, and how much is the
                                        per string extra width.

                                        2. The actual width, which is the
                                        extent less the overhang. Alternately
                                        tmOverhang is the difference between
                                        the width of a character when output
                                        singly versus in the interior of a
                                        string.

13.2  TEXTXFORM ─ Actual Text Appearance Information

This data structure describes the actual text appearance as displayed by the
device. If there are differences between the TEXTXFORM and FONTINFO data
structures, StrBlt/ExtTextOut is responsible for accommodating the
differences for which it has claimed abilities, as specified in the dpText
field in the GDIINFO data structure. However, there may be more differences
than the device can transform. In that case, GDI is responsible for
simulating the required transformations.

Most of the fields in this data structure correspond to the fields in the
LOGFONT data structure, but are expressed in device units. Notice that these
fields may not correspond exactly to the logical font. For example, if the
logical font specified a 19-unit font at string precision and the closest
available is a 9-unit font on a device capable of doubling, then Height in
the transform is 18.

  typedef struct {
   short  Height;
   short  Width;
   short  Escapement;
   short  Orientation;
   short  Weight;
   char   Italic;
   char   Underline;
   char   StrikeOut;
   char   OutPrecision;
   char   ClipPrecision;
   short  Accelerator;
   short  Overhang;
   } TEXTXFORM;

The fields within the TEXTXFORM data structure have the following meanings:


╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌─────────────────────────────────────────►
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Height                            Specifies the height of characters (ascent
                                  + descent) in device units.

Width                             Specifies the width in device units of the
                                  bounding box of the
                                  letter "X."

Escapement                        Specifies the angle in tenths of a degree
                                  counterclockwise from the X-axis of the
                                  vector passing through the origin of all
                                  the characters in the string.

Orientation                       Specifies the angle in tenths of a degree
                                  counterclockwise from the X-axis of the
                                  baseline of the character.

Weight                            Specifies the weight of the font ranging
                                  from 1 to 1000, with 400 being the value
                                  for the standard font.

Italic                            This field is a 1-byte flag that specifies
                                  whether or not the font is to be italic.
                                  If the low bit is set, the font is to be
                                  italic. All the other bits are to be zero.

Underline                         This field is a 1-byte flag that specifies
                                  whether or not the font is to be
                                  underlined. If the low bit is set, the
                                  font is to be underlined. All the other
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  font is to be underlined. All the other
                                  bits are to be zero.

StrikeOut                         This field is a 1-byte flag that specifies
                                  whether or not the font is to be struck
                                  out. If the low bit is set, the font is to
                                  be struck out. All the other bits are to
                                  be zero.

OutPrecision                      Specifies the required output precision
                                  for this font. Output precision is
                                  described in detail in the GDIINFO data
                                  structure. Output precision may be one of
                                  the following values:

                                  OUT_DEFAULT_PRECIS
                                  OUT_STRING_PRECIS
                                  OUT_CHARACTER_PRECIS
                                  OUT_STROKE_PRECIS
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  OUT_STROKE_PRECIS

ClipPrecision                     Specifies the required clipping precision
                                  for this font. Clipping precision is
                                  described in detail in the GDIINFO data
                                  structure given in Chapter 12, "Data
                                  Structures and File Formats." Clipping
                                  precision may be one of the following
                                  values:

                                  CLIP_DEFAULT_PRECIS
                                  CLIP_CHARACTER_PRECIS
                                  CLIP_STROKE_PRECIS

Accelerator                       This field has a bit-for-bit
                                  correspondence with the dpText field in
                                  the GDIINFO data structure. Each bit in
                                  this field is set if the corresponding
                                  ability is required to transform the
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  ability is required to transform the
                                  physical font (FONTINFO) into the
                                  displayed font (TEXTXFORM) as described by
                                  the logical font (LOGFONT).

                                  GDI uses the bitwise difference between
                                  the Accelerator field and dpText field to
                                  determine what abilities it should
                                  simulate. The device may use the
                                  Accelerator field to determine which
                                  attributes it should perform based upon
                                  what needs to be done, what it can do, and
                                  what GDI has simulated. By performing an
                                  AND operation on Accelerator and dpText,
                                  StrBlt can determine which transforms it
                                  is responsible for performing.

Overhang                          This field has the same meaning as the
                                  tmOverhang field in the TEXTMETRIC data
Field                             Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  tmOverhang field in the TEXTMETRIC data
                                  structure. This field is set by the device
                                  for device-realized fonts and is in device
                                  units. Notice that GDI uses additional
                                  overhang if it emboldens the font.




13.3  FONTINFO ─ The Physical Font

This version of FONTINFO is used to describe the format of the disk file for
the physical font. The other version given in Chapter 12, "Data Structures
and File Formats," refers to the format of FONTINFO when it resides in
memory. GDI translates the disk format to the memory format when it loads
the font.

For Windows 3.0, FONTINFO includes six new fields: dfFlags, dfAspace,
dfBspace, dfCspace, dfColorPointer, and dfReserved1. All device drivers can
still support the Windows 2.x version of FONTINFO. However, not all of them
will understand the Windows 3.0 version. To do so and access only Windows
3.0, a display driver must have the RC_BIGFONT bit set in the raster
capabilities field of GDIINFO. Otherwise, it will get the 2.x version.
Printers call the GDI function GetDeviceCaps() to see what bit the display
driver has set under RC_BIGFONT in GDIINFO.

The Windows 3.0 version of FONTINFO also includes the glyph table in
dfCharTable, which consists of structures that describe the bits for
characters in the font file. This version enables fonts to grow to more than
64K in size (i.e., the size limit in 0x200 fonts). This is made possible by
the use of 32-bit offsets to the character glyphs in dfCharTable.

Because of the 32-bit offsets and their potentially large size, these fonts
are primarily designed for use on systems that are running in protected
mode, in which there is lots of memory, and on an 80386 (or higher)
processor, where 32-bit registers can be used to get to the character
glyphs. Therefore, we recommend that a device driver use 0x300 fonts (i.e.,
turn on the RC_BIGFONT bit) only when the preceding conditions are present.
If those conditions are not met, 0x200 fonts are the better format. See the
VGA sources on the DDK disks for sample code that supports different
formats, depending on the Windows environment.

The following are the fields of the FONTINFO data structure:

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

The constant "DF_MAPSIZE" must be defined prior to the INCLUDE statement of
the GDIDEFS.INC file, or the array will default to one character element.
This leaves room only for a single set of NULL to designate no typeface
name, no device name, and no bitmaps.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The fields within the FONTINFO data structure have the following meanings:

╓┌──────────────────┌─────────────────────────────┌──────────────────────────►
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
dfVersion          Two bytes specifying the
                   version (0200H or 0300H) of
                   the file.

dfSize             Four bytes specifying the
                   total size of the file in
                   bytes.

dfCopyright        60 bytes specifying
                   copyright information.

dfType             Two bytes specifying the
                   type of fontfile.

                   The low-order byte is
                   exclusively for GDI use. If
                   the low-order bit of the
                   WORD is zero, it is a bitmap
                   (raster) fontfile. If the
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   (raster) fontfile. If the
                   low-order bit is 1, it is a
                   vector fontfile. The second
                   bit is reserved and must be
                   zero. If no bits follow in
                   the file and the bits are
                   located in memory at a fixed
                   address specified in
                   dfBitsOffset, the third bit
                   is set to 1; otherwise, the
                   bit is set to zero. The
                   high-order bit of the low
                   byte is set if the font was
                   realized by a device. The
                   remaining bits in the low
                   byte are reserved and set to
                   zero.

                   The high byte is reserved
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   The high byte is reserved
                   for device use and will
                   always be set to zero for
                   GDI-realized standard fonts.
                   Physical fonts with the
                   high-order bit of the low
                   byte set may use this byte
                   to describe themselves. GDI
                   will never inspect the high
                   byte.

dfPoints           Two bytes specifying the
                   nominal point size at which
                   this character set looks
                   best.

dfVertRes          Two bytes specifying the
                   nominal vertical resolution
                   (dots-per-inch) at which
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   (dots-per-inch) at which
                   this character set was
                   digitized.

dfHorizRes         Two bytes specifying the
                   nominal horizontal
                   resolution (dots-per-inch)
                   at which this character set
                   was digitized.

dfAscent           Two bytes specifying the
                   distance from the top of a
                   character definition cell to
                   the baseline of the
                   typographical font. It is
                   useful for aligning the
                   baselines of fonts of
                   different heights.

Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

dfInternalLeading  Specifies the amount of
                   leading inside the bounds
                   set by dfPixHeight. Accent
                   marks may occur in this area.
                   This may be zero at the
                   designer's option.

dfExternalLeading  Specifies the amount of
                   extra leading that the
                   designer requests the
                   application add between rows.
                   Since this area is outside
                   of the font proper, it
                   contains no marks and will
                   not be altered by text
                   output calls in either the
                   OPAQUE or TRANSPARENT mode.
                   This may be zero at the
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   This may be zero at the
                   designer's option.

dfItalic           One byte specifying whether
                   or not the character
                   definition data represent an
                   italic font. The low-order
                   bit is 1 if the flag is set.
                   All the other bits are zero.

dfUnderline        One byte specifying whether
                   or not the character
                   definition data represent an
                   underlined font. The
                   low-order bit is 1 if the
                   flag is set. All the other
                   bits are zero.

dfStrikeOut        One byte specifying whether
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
dfStrikeOut        One byte specifying whether
                   or not the character
                   definition data represent a
                   struckout font. The
                   low-order bit is 1 if the
                   flag is set. All the other
                   bits are zero.

dfWeight           Two bytes specifying the
                   weight of the characters in
                   the character definition
                   data, on a scale of 1 to
                   1000. A dfWeight of 400
                   specifies a regular weight.

dfCharSet          One byte specifying the
                   character set defined by
                   this font.

Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

dfPixWidth         Two bytes. For vector fonts,
                   specifies the width of the
                   grid on which the font was
                   digitized. For raster fonts,
                   if dfPixWidth is nonzero, it
                   represents the width for all
                   the characters in the
                   bitmap; if it is zero, the
                   font has variable width
                   characters whose widths are
                   specified in the dfCharTable
                   array.

dfPixHeight        Two bytes specifying the
                   height of the character
                   bitmap (raster fonts), or
                   the height of the grid on
                   which a vector font was
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   which a vector font was
                   digitized.

dfPitchAndFamily   Specifies the pitch and font
                   family. The low bit is set
                   if the font is variable
                   pitch. The high four bits
                   give the family name of the
                   font. Font families describe
                   in a general way the look of
                   a font. They are intended
                   for specifying fonts when
                   the exact face name desired
                   is not available. The
                   families are as follows:

                   FF_DONTCARE (0&lt;&lt;4)            Don't care or don't know.

                   FF_ROMAN (1&lt;&lt;4)               Proportionally spaced fonts
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   FF_ROMAN (1&lt;&lt;4)               Proportionally spaced fonts
                                                 with serifs.

                   FF_SWISS (2&lt;&lt;4)               Proportionally spaced font
                                                 without serifs.

                   FF_MODERN (3&lt;&lt;4)              Fixed-pitch fonts.

                   FF_SCRIPT (4&lt;&lt;4)              Cursive or script fonts.
                                                 (Both are designed to look
                                                 at least vaguely like
                                                 handwriting. Script fonts
                                                 have joined letters; cursive
                                                 fonts do not.)

                   Family                        Description

                   FF_DECORATIVE (5&lt;&lt;4)          Novelty fonts.

Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

dfAvgWidth         Two bytes specifying the
                   width of characters in the
                   font. For fixed-pitch fonts,
                   this is the same as
                   dfPixWidth. For
                   variable-pitch fonts, this
                   is the width of the
                   character "X."

dfMaxWidth         Two bytes specifying the
                   maximum pixel width of any
                   character in the font. For
                   fixed-pitch fonts, this is
                   simply dfPixWidth.

dfFirstChar        One byte specifying the
                   first character code defined
                   by this font. Character
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   by this font. Character
                   definitions are stored only
                   for the characters
                   actually present in a font.
                   Therefore, use this field
                   when calculating indexes
                   into either dfBits or
                   dfCharOffset.

dfLastChar         One byte specifying the last
                   character code defined by
                   this font. Notice that all
                   the characters with codes
                   between dfFirstChar and
                   dfLastChar must be present
                   in the font character
                   definitions.

dfDefaultChar      One byte specifying the
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
dfDefaultChar      One byte specifying the
                   character to substitute
                   whenever a string contains a
                   character out of the range.
                   The character is given
                   relative to dfFirstChar so
                   that  dfDefaultChar is the
                   actual value of the
                   character less dfFirstChar.
                   The dfDefaultChar should
                   indicate a special character
                   that is not a space.

dfBreakChar        One byte specifying the
                   character that will define
                   word breaks. This character
                   defines word breaks for word
                   wrapping and word spacing
                   justification. The character
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   justification. The character
                   is given relative to
                   dfFirstChar so that
                   dfBreakChar is the actual
                   value of the character less
                   that of dfFirstChar. The
                   dfBreakChar is normally (32 -
                   dfFirstChar), which is an
                   ASCII space.

dfWidthBytes       Two bytes specifying the
                   number of bytes in each row
                   of the bitmap. This is
                   always even, so that the
                   rows start on WORD
                   boundaries.

                   For vector fonts, this field
                   has no meaning.
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   has no meaning.

dfDevice           Four bytes specifying the
                   offset in the file to the
                   string giving the device
                   name. For a generic font,
                   this value is zero.

dfFace             Four bytes specifying the
                   offset in the file to the
                   NULL-terminated string that
                   names the face.

dfBitsPointer      Four bytes specifying the
                   absolute machine address of
                   the bitmap. This is set by
                   GDI at load time. The
                   dfBitsPointer is guaranteed

dfBitsOffset       Four bytes specifying the
                   offset in the file to the
                   beginning of the bitmap
                   information. If the 04H bit
                   in the dfType is set, then
                   dfBitsOffset is an absolute
                   address of the bitmap
                   (probably in ROM).

                   For raster fonts, it points
                   to a sequence of bytes that
                   make up the bitmap of the
                   font, whose height is the
                   height of the font, and
                   whose width is the sum of
                   the widths of the characters

                   the next WORD boundary.

                   For vector fonts, it points
                   to a string of bytes or
                   words (depending on the size
                   of the grid on which the
                   font was digitized) that
                   specify the strokes for each
                   character of the font. The
                   dfBits-

dfAspace           Two bytes specifying the
                   global A space, if any. The
                   dfAspace is the distance
                   from the current position to
                   the left edge of the bitmap.

dfBspace           Two bytes specifying the
                   global B space, if any. The
                   dfBspace is the width of the
                   character.

dfCspace           Two bytes specifying the
                   global C space, if any. The
                   dfCspace is the distance
                   from the right edge of the
                   bitmap to the new current
                   position. The increment of a

                   character is the sum of the
                   three spaces. These apply to
                   all glyphs and is the case
                   for DFF_ABCFIXED.

dfColorPointer     Two bytes specifying the
                   offset to the color table
                   for color fonts, if any. The
                   format of the bits is like a
                   DIB, but without the header.
                   That is, the characters are
                   not split up into disjoint
                   bytes. Instead, they are
                   left intact. If no color
                   table is needed, this entry
                   is NULL.

dfCharTable        For raster fonts, the
                   CharTable is an array of
                   entries each consisting of
                   two 2-byte WORDs for Windows
                   2.x and three 2-byte WORDs
                   for Windows 3.0. The first
                   WORD of each entry is the
                   character width. The second
                   WORD of each entry is the
                   byte offset from the
                   beginning of the FONTINFO
                   structure to the character
                   bitmap. For Windows 3.0, the
                   second and third WORD are
                   used for the offset.

                   There is one extra entry at
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   There is one extra entry at
                   the end of this table that
                   describes an absolute-space
                   character. This entry
                   corresponds to a character
                   that is guaranteed to be
                   blank; this character is not
                   part of the normal character
                   set.

                   The number of entries in the
                   table is calculated as
                   (( dfLastChar - dfFirstChar)
                   + 2). This includes a spare,
                   the sentinel offset
                   mentioned in the following
                   paragraph.

                   For fixed-pitch vector fonts,
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   For fixed-pitch vector fonts,
                   each 2-byte entry in this
                   array specifies the offset
                   from the start of the bitmap
                   to the beginning of the
                   string of stroke
                   specification units for the
                   character. The number of
                   bytes or WORDs to be used
                   for a particular character
                   is calculated by subtracting
                   its entry from the next one,
                   so that there is a  sentinel
                   at the end of the array of
                   values.

                   For proportionally spaced
                   vector fonts, each 4-byte
                   entry is divided into two

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   entry is divided into two
                   2-byte fields. The first
                   field gives the starting
                   offset from the start of the
                   bitmap of the character
                   strokes. The second field
                   gives the pixel width of the
                   character.

&lt;facename&gt;         An ASCII character string
                   specifying the name of the
                   font face. The size of this
                   field is the length of the
                   string plus a NULL
                   terminator.

&lt;devicename&gt;       An ASCII character string
                   specifying the name of the
                   device if this font file is
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   device if this font file is
                   for a specific device. The
                   size of this field is the
                   length of the string plus a
                   NULL terminator.

&lt;bitmaps&gt;          This field contains the
                   character bitmap definitions.
                   Each character is stored as
                   a contiguous set of bytes.
                   (In the old font format,
                   this was not the case.)

                   The first byte contains the
                   first eight bits of the
                   first scanline (i.e., the
                   top line of the character).
                   The second byte contains the
                   first eight bits of the
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   first eight bits of the
                   second scanline. This
                   continues until what amounts
                   to a first "column" is
                   completely defined.

                   The following byte contains
                   the next eight bits of the
                   first scanline, padded with
                   zeros on the right if
                   necessary (and so on, down
                   through the second "column").
                   If the glyph is quite narrow,
                   each scanline is covered by
                   one byte, with bits set to
                   zero as necessary for
                   padding. If the glyph is
                   very wide, a third or even
                   fourth set of bytes can be
Field              Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                   fourth set of bytes can be
                   present.

                   NOTE The character bitmaps
                   must be stored contiguously
                   and
                   arranged in ascending order.

                   The following is a
                   single-character example, in
                   which are given the bytes
                   for a 12x14 pixel character,
                   as shown here schematically.

                   ............

                   The bytes are given here in
                   two sets, because the
                   character is less than 17
                   pixels wide.

                   Notice that in the second
                   set of bytes, the second
                   digit of each is always zero.
                   It would correspond to the
                   13th through 16th pixels on
                   the right side of the
                   character, if they were
                   present.



The Windows 2.x version dfCharTable has a GlyphEntry structure with the
following format:

  GlyphEntry struc
  geWidth   dw ? ; width of character bitmap in pixels
  geOffset  dw ? ; pointer to the bits
  GlyphEntry ends

The Windows 3.0 version of the dfCharTable is dependent on the format of the
Glyph bitmap.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

The only format supported in Windows 3.0 will be DFF_FIXED and
DFF_PROPORTIONAL.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  DFF_FIXED
  DFF_PROPORTIONAL

  GlyphEntry struc
  geWidth   dw ? ; width of character bitmap in pixels
  geOffset  dd ? ; pointer to the bits
  GlyphEntry ends

  DFF_ABCFIXED
  DFF_ABCPROPORTIONAL

  GlyphEntry struc
  geWidth  dw ?   ; width of character bitmap in pixels
  geOffset  dd ?   ; pointer to the bits
  geAspace  dd ?   ; A space in fractional pixels (16.16)
  geBspace  dd ?   ; B space in fractional pixels (16.16)
  geCspace  dw ?   ; C space in fractional pixels (16.16)
  GlyphEntry ends

The fractional pixels are expressed as a 32-bit signed number with an
implicit binary point between bits 15 and 16. This is referred to as a 16.16
("sixteen dot sixteen") fixed-point number.

The ABC spacing here is the same as defined above. However, here there are
specific sets for each character.

  DFF_1COLOR
  DFF_16COLOR
  DFF_256COLOR
  DFF_RGBCOLOR

  GlyphEntry struc
  geWidth   dw ?   ; width of character bitmap in pixels
  geOffset  dd ?   ; pointer to the bits
  geHeight  dw ?   ; height of character bitmap in pixels
  geAspace  dd ?   ; A space in fractional pixels (16.16)
  geBspace  dd ?   ; B space in fractional pixels (16.16)
  geCspace  dd ?   ; C space in fractional pixels (16.16)
  GlyphEntry ends

  DFF_1COLOR means 8 pixels per byte

  DFF_16COLOR means 2 pixels per byte

  DFF_256COLOR means 1 pixel per byte

  DFF_RGBCOLOR means RGBquads






Chapter 14  Raster Operation Codes and Definitions
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This chapter provides a table of raster operation codes and their
definitions. The raster operation codes define the ways in which BitBlt
combines the bits in a source bitmap with the bits in a brush or pattern
bitmap and the bits in the destination bitmap.

The operands used in the operations are as follows:

╓┌───────────┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
S           Source bitmap
P           Paintbrush or Pattern currently selected
D           Destination bitmap


The Boolean operators used in these operations are as follows:

╓┌──────────────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
o                  Bitwise OR
x                  Bitwise Exclusive OR
a                  Bitwise AND
n                  Bitwise NOT (invert)


The operations are presented here in reverse Polish notation. For example,
the operation DPSoo performs a logical "OR" on the source and pattern and,
then, performs another logical "OR" with the destination. The result is then
stored in the destination.

Notice that there are alternate spellings of the same function. Therefore,
although a particular spelling may not be in the list, an equivalent form
will be. For example, "DPoSo" is a form equivalent to "DPSoo."

In general, the functions are spelled in such a way that it is easiest to
read them outward from the place at which they change from upper to lower
case. For example, PSDPSanaxx may be read as follows:

  PSD PSa naxx: `and' source with pattern.
  PSDPSa n axx: complement result.
  PS D PSan a xx: `and' with destination.
  P S PDPSana x x: `xor' with source.
  P SDPSanax x: `xor' with pattern.

The following is another, more complex example: (This expansion is of ROP
0017h from the table below.)

  The ROP: SSPxDSxaxn

The expansion:

  S SPx DSxaxn: `xor' source and pattern.
  SSPx DSx axn: `xor' destination and source.
  S [SPx][DSx]a xn: `and' the bracketed items.
  S SPxDSxa x n: `xor' result of last step with source.
  SSPxDSxax n: complement result, and put into destination.


14.1  The Operation Codes

Each raster operation code is a 32-bit integer value; the high-order WORD of
which is a Boolean operation index, and the low-order WORD of which is the
operation code. The 16-bit operation index is a zero-extended 8-bit value
that represents the result of the Boolean operation on predefined pattern
(P), source (S), and destination (D) values. For example, the operation
indices for the PSo, PSon, and DPSoo operations are as follows:

╓┌────────────┌──┌──┌────┌─────┌──────┌──────────────────────────────────────╖
P            S  D  PSo  PSon  DPSoo  Arbitrary function

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Any Boolean function can be represented by the string of 1's and 0's on the
right side of such a table. In this case, PSon is the string 00000011 (read
from the bottom up), which is hexadecimal 03. (Recall that this is then
zero-extended to the left: 0x0003.) Notice the PSon function in line 4 of
the table.

In general, any arbitrary function such as the one on the far right above,
has a unique hexadecimal number associated with it (in this case, 0x59). By
looking in the table, one then finds the appropriate Rop (in this case,
0x00590609) and a function that evaluates it (DPSnox).

The first four digits of each opcode determine the location of the raster
operation in the table: the PSo operation is in line 252 (hex FC) of the
table, DPSoo is in line 254 (hex FE), and so on.

The most commonly used Rops have been given special names. Therefore, it is
recommended that programs define the common name to be the Rop number and,
then, use the common name throughout, to be consistent with the current "no
magic numbers" style.

Chapter 15  Miscellaneous Character Set Tables
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This chapter defines the major character sets used with Microsoft Windows
3.0 and provides figures with samples of them.

One of the attributes of a Windows font is its character set. A character
set is a mapping of byte values to graphic symbols. For example, the ASCII
character set maps the number 65 to the letter "A."

The following are the two most common character sets for Windows fonts:


  ■   ANSI, the standard Windows font

  ■   OEM, which refers to the native character set of the computer on which
      Windows is running. For example, on IBM PC computers used in the
      United States, the OEM character set is the IBM PC character set.


Samples of these character set tables are provided in Figures 15.1 and 15.2.


A printer driver should attempt to support ANSI whenever possible. If
necessary, the printer should implement a translation table to convert ANSI
codes to the printer's (or printer font's) native character set. For
example, the PCL/HP LaserJet driver supplied with Windows will convert ANSI
into US ASCII, HP Roman 8, or ECMA 94, depending on the character set of the
selected printer font. This requires that the printer font contain symbols
similar to those used in ANSI.

The Microsoft Windows graphics device interface (GDI) considers a font's
character set as the most important attribute when selecting a font from
those available. The character set has a high weight to ensure that the
output is at least meaningful if not beautiful. To  prevent unexpected
results, drivers that implement their own font mappers in the
RealizeObject() function should use criteria similar to GDI's when selecting
fonts.

The Windows Symbol (CHARSET_SYMBOL) character set is new for Windows 3.0 and
is shown in Figure 15.3. It is intended for selecting the standard symbols
font that is used for building mathematical formulas and for random graphics
symbols such as those used in desktop publishing.

Other character sets are occasionally used for special purposes in specific
applications or specialized drivers. If an application encounters a
character set that it does not recognize when enumerating fonts, it should
remember the font and character set index to allow the user to select the
font and print it, unless it relies on the assignment of characters to byte
values. The application should make no assumptions about character
assignments.

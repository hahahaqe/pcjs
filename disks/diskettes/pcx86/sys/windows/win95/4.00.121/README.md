## Notes

This early build of Windows 95 was also known as "Chicago Beta 1" and was released on June 7, 1994.

The internal version was 4.00.121.  This is from my private collection and predates other known copies of "Beta 1" (eg, those with internal version 4.00.122).

Successfully installed in DOSBox-x with Beta Site ID 229911 and password 30a22ccb9.
